Read the first installment in this blog serieshere. Donna Godley is a fifth grade science teacher at Tryon Elementary School in North Carolina and her school's site coordinator, responsible for supporting her fellow teachers and communicating with the other key players in the program. In March and August 2021, she attended professional development on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in preparation for implementing it with her students. We spoke with Donna to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: How did you feel when you learned you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? Donna:Our Superintendent signed our school up and was looking for teachers to be a part of the program. I teach 5th grade science and were departmentalized. So after I volunteered, I also became a coordinator for my school. I worked with some of the Smithsonian Science units before and traveled to D.C. with other teachers for Smithsonian-related things several years ago. The quality of the Smithsonian programs are usually pretty good, so I felt like the effort I would be putting into it would be worth it for my students. What was your experience with the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom module you covered during the professional development? What was your experience going through the curriculum during the professional development? My unit was an [Engineering] design unit, and its about moving water from one area to another. The people that weve worked with anytime weve done the training have been great. Its been virtual, of course, because of COVID but the instructors have always been really good. The written materials, especially the teacher manual, is always so self explanatory because it covers everything in great detail. You can watch the videos if you have questions on anything. The teacher materials and the resources the Smithsonian Science Education Center provides are exceptional. Actually sitting through the material makes me more familiar with it, and I could teach the lessons without professional development because the materials are so high quality.  In this screenshot from PD, Donna describes her group's rationale for sorting images of landforms in a jamboard. What was it like for you to work with other teachers and coordinators during the training? It was great to receive feedback from others. I worked with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers from my school to help them figure out how they were going to teach the lessons. At the end of each year we hold a debrief to discuss highlights and how were going to work through certain challenges and implement them for the following school year. What has this experience been like for your students? The kids have loved it. With all of the hands-on activities, they say oh, were really scientists! It was so exciting for them to see crates of new materials they were going to work with. They really enjoy doing the design units because they had the opportunity to be creative and use the materials how they liked. Usually when Im doing things in my classroom, theres not a wealth of material to use and were limited to what Ive purchased. Everyone was very engaged because they were so enthralled with everything they were getting to use. They really enjoy being creative and it has really helped them with teamwork. In 5th grade, getting along and working together is a challenge. Theyre motivated to work together during this unit, which is a great thing to have toward the end of the school year. What is a memorable takeaway for you from professional development training? Actually doing the materials together was really impactful to me. Were learning how to move water from one place to another and design water filtration systems. There were some funny moments along the way that were memorable tooat one point my filter completely collapsed! When I started doing this unit with the kids, I could make suggestions along the way so that they didnt completely lose everything. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Ive always considered myself a constructionist, where I dont tell students things but let them discover it for themselves. This professional development reemphasized that method of teaching and how important it is. Once the students learn it for themselves, they dont forget it. If theyre just told what to do, it goes in one ear and out the other. If they discover it for themselves, they can apply it to other situations.",800.0

Imagine yourself walking into a room, and before you even utter a word, your clothing choices speak volumes about who you are. Developing your personal style is a beautiful journey of self-discovery, a process that unfolds with time and a dash of experimentation. Don't be afraid to break the mold, drawing inspiration from iconic fashion figures who dared to be different. Think of Coco Chanel, who revolutionized women's fashion with comfortable yet chic designs, or David Bowie, whose flamboyant costumes became an extension of his artistic persona. Embrace the freedom to mix and match unexpected pieces, like a flowy maxi skirt with a graphic tee, creating a fusion of styles that reflects your individuality. Explore various silhouettes  a tailored jumpsuit for a powerful statement when you need to command attention, or a relaxed bohemian dress for a carefree vibe that exudes effortless beauty. Ultimately, embrace what ignites confidence within you. Maybe it's a pop of color that reflects your vibrant personality, or a classic silhouette that exudes timeless elegance. Remember, fashion is a canvas, and you are the artist  create a masterpiece that reflects the truest essence of you. As the renowned designer Miuccia Prada once said, ""What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is instant language.""

2024-04-28 15:56:31,Disease_Symptoms,8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/8-signs-and-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism/,"Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism: Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition. So, it is one of the majorhypothyroidism effectsthat your body faces. Other interesting studies have proven that around 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels have stated to suffer from dry skin for other reasons. Recent studies have shown that 50% of people suffering from hypothyroidism have stated that their skin condition has gotten worse within a year of getting affected. So, if you are one of those unfortunate victims of dry skin, check for your thyroid level right away! Lower thyroid levels surely know how to put some brakes on the colon. Constipation will affect around 17% of those people suffering from hypothyroidism. Around 20% of people with hypothyroidism have stated that their constipation has gotten worse with time. Even though it is a common complaint among patients, it is uncommon for constipation to be the most severe symptom around here.

Flipping through photo albums as a child, Shannon Brogdon-Grantham discovered the stories of relatives from the past she never got to meet. Its this activity that inspired her to go after a career as a photo conservator at the Smithsonians Museum Conservation Institute. We always had the family photo albums out at the holidays to look through them. I really got to know a lot of my relatives through photography, Shannon said, I always thought it was really cool that you could see someone from the past and be connected with them. She began college with thinking about a job in forensic medicine, which is the usage of medical knowledge to figure out how a person mightve been hurt during a crime, but she realized her heart was set on a different calling. She switched majors and began to study art history. Thats when she learned about the field of photographic conservation. Even though most people might think of photographs in a photo album, pictures are very important for lots of other reasons. Just like artwork and fossils are clues into the past experiences of people and animals, photographs help tell the stories of people from years ago. By protecting and conserving photos, Shannon can help provide people with important information about the lives of people from different times and places.  Shannon loved science from a young age. She especially loved dissecting an owl pellet, or poop, during class in fourth grade. It was a little gross, but to her, it was mostly exciting. As disgusting as that is, it was really cool, and I was hooked ever since then with science, she explained, I went to a specialty high school that was health sciences and engineering. So, thats when my interest in medicine took hold. Shannon was interested in medicine because she wanted to help people. As a photo conservator shes still helping people. Im one of the few people that gets to connect the past and the present and the future through preservation, Shannon said. Even though shes not curing colds, Shannon is still helping to protect people by making sure their stories can be shared for years to come. Shes protecting peoples cultural heritage by preserving their photos. In addition to protecting photos, Shannon also works to protect mixed media objects that incorporate photos, such as quilts made with photographic images. Quilts can be made to help keep people warm at night, but theyre also made for lots of other reasons, like artistic expression. By understanding how certain quilts are made, Shannon has helped to make sure that these quilts can be preserved for generations to come. Shannon comes from a family of educators, and shes been able to combine education, science, history and art in her career as a photo conservator. Her work is important when it comes to inspiring and teaching people about the diverse experiences of our world.

From the extravagant ballgowns of the 18th century, symbolizing wealth and social standing, to the rise of utilitarian and comfortable athleisure in the 21st century, reflecting a more active and casual lifestyle, fashion serves as a mirror to the times we live in. Consider the flapper dresses of the 1920s, a symbol of women's liberation and rebellion against societal norms, a movement fueled by newfound independence after World War I. Or, look at the rise of power suits in the 1980s, reflecting the growing power of women in the workplace as they shattered glass ceilings and demanded equality. Today, with a growing focus on environmental consciousness, sustainability and ethical production are becoming prominent considerations for both fashion houses and discerning consumers. Innovative materials derived from recycled plastic or organic fabrics are being used, and production processes are being scrutinized to minimize environmental impact. Fashion is no longer just about aesthetics; it's a conversation starter about social issues and environmental responsibility. It's a powerful tool for activism, with designers using their platforms to raise awareness about climate change, fair labor practices, and social justice issues. The ever-evolving landscape of fashion reflects the ever-changing world around us, and its influence extends far beyond clothing trends.

2024-04-28 15:59:36,science_education,A Sign of Apocalypse,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/sign-apocalypse,"Throughout mankinds history we have looked to the sky for inspiration, navigation, and guidance in understanding our world. Astronomical phenomena have influenced our creation myths and religions. The magnificent display of a lunar eclipse has impacted cultures and inspired fear throughout mankind's past. The lunar eclipse is one of the most documented astronomical occurrences in history. For thousands of years, civilizations have been observing its red glow and attributing meaning to the sight. Many feared that the lunar eclipse was an omen of evil or an indication that tragic events were on the horizon. The Ancient Mesopotamians, one of the early cultures to study astronomy and track the movements of celestial objects, believed that during the lunar eclipse, the Moon was being attacked by demons. Their astronomical observations and recordings were advanced enough that they could predict when a lunar eclipse would occur. In 1502 Christopher Columbus and his men were stranded in Jamaica and had been surviving with help from the native Tano people. However, the natives grew increasingly impatient with the European squatters beginning to refuse aid and supplies to Columbus and his men. Columbus used information from an almanac of astronomical tables, which informed him of the occurrence of a total lunar eclipse within a few days. He told the natives that if they did not continue giving him food and supplies his god would inflame the Moon with his wrath as a sign of future punishment. As predicted the lunar eclipse followed. Terrified by the blood-colored Moon they acquiesced to Columbus demands. Lunar eclipses have also aided in furthering our understanding of our universe. The Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos, known for proposing the first Helio-Centric (sun-centered) model of the solar system made great strides in the field of astronomy. He famously used the occurrence of a lunar eclipse and his understanding of mathematics to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. By using a known size of the Earth and measuring the duration of the lunar eclipse, he was able to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While relatively inaccurate, he was the first to ever do this calculation. While for most people the lunar eclipse no longer signifies the coming of an apocalyptic event, the mystique surrounding the infamous Blood Moon holds to this day. The lunar eclipse is in fact not mystical at all; it is quite simply the Earth passing in between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. As the Moon begins to be shadowed from part of the Sun's light, the Moon will appear to dim (see Figure 1). This is when the Moon passes into an area called the penumbra, the part of the shadow where the entirety of the Moon is still illuminated by the Sunlight, however part of the Sunlight is blocked by the Earth causing the drop in brightness. When just this happens it is called a penumbral eclipse and this accounts for most lunar eclipses. On even rarer occasions, the Moon will then begin to disappear into the night sky. This occurs as the Moon passes into the umbra, where all direct sunlight is blocked casting a dark shadow on the Moon. The Moon will fully disappear entering what is called totality. Then the lunar eclipse shows its true colors. Ethan GevinsonFigure 1. Parts of a lunar eclipse. Image not to scale. Even when the Moon is entirely in the umbral shadow, some light manages to reach the Moon by passing around the Earth, through the atmosphere. This causes a change in color due to a principle called Rayleigh scattering, and this is the same principle that gives the sky its blue color. This principle states that when light passes through a medium such as the atmosphere, shorter wavelength of light is scattered more. What we end up seeing is that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more than red light since blue light has a shorter wavelength (e.g. Figure 2). This gives the effect of different colors of light being refracted at different angles similar to light passing through a prism. Ethan GevinsonFigure 2. Bluer light has a shorter wavelength and redder light has a longer wavelength. This is also why sunrises and sunsets appear red. As the Sun appears to set on the horizon, the sunlight passes through the longer path of Earths atmosphere to reach your eyes than when it appears high in the sky. The blue light is scattered away while the red light could reach us. Interestingly, when we are looking at a lunar eclipse, the red light projected onto the Moon is the light of sunrises and sunsets that we see on Earth (Figure 3). So if you manage to see a blood Moon, you can consider yourself lucky, as you are seeing the light from all of the sunsets and sunrises from around the world being projected onto the Moon. Ethan GevinsonFigure 3. The light from the Sun being scattered by the atmosphere, giving the Moon its red color. When is the next lunar eclipse? On May 5th, 2023 between 15:15 and 19:32 UTC the Moon will pass into the Penumbra creating a nearly total penumbral eclipse visible from most of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 5). This type of eclipse unfortunately will not result in the iconic Blood Moon, just simply a dimming of the Moon with darker shading on one side. Whether you are able to see the upcoming eclipse or will be holding out until the next total lunar eclipse in March of 2025 it is an impressive sight to behold. People have always looked to the skies for answers and have learned from events like the lunar eclipse. To join them all you need to do is look it up. Ethan GevinsonFigure 4.

2024-04-28 15:59:43,science_education,A Global Goals Guide: From Start to Finish,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/global-goals-guide-start-finish,"You may be familiar with the action-focused aim of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides. As explained by Laurie Rosatone, Division Director of Curriculum, Digital Media, and Communications at the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC), the goal is to have anyone picking up these guides feel like there is something that they want to and can do and that they can act in their local communities around these huge global challenges. So, how does the SSEC strive toward this goal while creating the Global Goals guides? How are topics selected among the many issues that the world is facing? Whats the process for developing activities that are as engaging as possible? How is each guide created with accessibility and impact in mind? As an intern for the upcomingBiotechnology!community research guide, I talked with the rest of the SSEC team to dig into these big questions. Heres everything that goes into a Global Goals guide, from start to finish. Each guides beginning traces all the way back to 20162018, when a deep dive into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals produced alist of tentative topics. Since then, funders have helped to transform the early vision into reality: published guides used by young people around the world! The process of connecting with funders begins with Holly Glover, SSEC's Division Director of Advancement and Partnerships. She says, Since the inception of the SDGs, interest from the funding community around education for sustainable development has grown significantly. These funding partners are excited to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Project. As we are seeking to achieve a joint impact with partners, I look at which guides and resources are left unfunded, and seek to align those priority areas with those of our partners. For theBiotechnology!guide, she explains, Biotechnology!was funded by Johnson & Johnson, whose business and philanthropic priorities align to the topics covered within the guide. After receiving funding, the first step is getting organized. Hannah Osborn, Project Manager at SSEC, starts by creating a schedule. She says of her work, I start with the questions, What have we been tasked to do? What is our timeline? How does our budget line up? I then backflow a schedule from there. Once the timeline is constructed, the research begins. The curriculum developers start to explore by digging into big issues surrounding the guides topic and consulting key players in the field. That research is synthesized into an outline detailing the proposed parts of the guide and the essential understandings students will develop while using it. After high-level review and approval of the outline, the guide is ready to move onto the drafting stage. As an intern, I worked with Curriculum Developers Heidi Gibson and Logan Schmidt to conduct further background research and develop activities for the upcomingBiotechnology!guide. Along with our five-strong intern team (made up of high schoolers, college students, and teachers!), I identified sources, probed through research papers, and conducted interviews with subject matter experts to get a strong understanding of each topic. We then worked on integrating key takeaways into engaging activities, which involved brainstorming, gathering data and information, and writing drafts. As we wrapped up our work, Heidi and Logan incorporated the research and activities into writing the initial draft of the guide. This first draft then goes through a rigorous review process that involves a number of voices. Field testing is done with teachers around the world to obtain their feedback as guide users. Technical reviews by experts ensure that the information shared in the guides is scientifically accurate and clear. Internal feedback, involving reviews by Laurie Rosatone and SSEC Director Dr. Carol ODonnell, provide further suggestions that make the guide as user-friendly and impactful as possible. After all of this feedback is integrated into improving the draft, the guide is copy-edited and designed by professionals. Then, it is finally ready to be published! SSECs Marketing & Communications team spreads the word about the completely free, newly released guide through digital marketing (i.e. social media posts and paid advertisements), blog posts, and press releases. Once the guide is released and shared, students and educators everywhere can access it from their devices. To expand the impact of Global Goals, Katherine Blanchard, Assistant Director of Professional Services, and Jackie Kolb, Program Specialist work with educators to implement the guides in their learning communities. Katherine says of their work, When a guide is first released, theres a balance between marketing and implementationwhos sharing that this exists versus whos providing training to actually use it. That gap between knowing about it and using it is one of the biggest things we work to fill. Theres a lot of recruitment of interested educators, building out and developing partnerships for projects (e.g. implementation in certain countries), and working with educators to implement the guides. Finally, the guide enters the final, paramount stage: being used by youth around the world! From beginning to end, youths interests and their ability to ignite change are the foundation of the guides themselves, as Laurie explains: Bringing respect for different peoples backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives of problem-solving into the classroom is at the heart of these Global Goals guides. Youre starting with the youthwho arethey? Instead of Who am I to think that I can do science? its Here I am and heres what Im bringing to this. It is really powerful to think about that subtle shift being that important to unlocking students confidence, curiosity, and sense of connection. Its not about empowering them, its tapping into their own sense of agency. I want to give them the confidence that they have the knowledge to step forward. Guide users and the change they have created around the world inspire the SSEC, and were incredibly glad to be a part of that process. Although this post details the development of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides from beginning to end, we know that sharing them with youth is just the beginning of everyone working together towards a sustainable future.",1004.0

Cheeks are a key area for facial shaping. As we age, cheeks can lose volume, leading to a sunken appearance and more prominent smile lines. Dermal fillers can be used to plump up the cheeks, lifting them for a more youthful and sculpted look. The jawline plays a significant role in defining your face shape. Facial contouring with dermal fillers can enhance your jawline, creating a sharper definition and improving overall facial balance. This can result in a more youthful and sculpted appearance. A weak or recessed chin can throw off the balance of your entire face. Dermal fillers offer a solution, adding volume to the chin and projecting it forward. This creates a more balanced profile and enhances facial harmony. Temples are another area susceptible to volume loss, causing the skin to appear hollow. Facial contouring can address this by filling the temples with dermal fillers, restoring a youthful fullness and smoothing out the appearance. The under-eye area is a common concern for many. Dark circles and hollowness can make you look tired and older. Facial contouring with dermal fillers can address both issues. Fillers add volume to the under-eye area, reducing the appearance of hollowness and minimizing the shadows that contribute to dark circles. This results in a refreshed and more youthful under-eye appearance.",249.0
2024-04-28 15:56:45,Disease_Symptoms,The Vitamin D Deficiency Test: How Can You Find Out If You Are Deficient?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/vitamin-d-deficiency-test/,"One of the common deficiencies that most people are suffering from is Vitamin D deficiency. Doctors are recommending avitamin d deficiency testto find out where you currently stand. This form of deficiency will cause issues with your muscle and bones. It affects people over the age of 65 mostly and those with darker skin tones. But, with proper advice and a doctor’s help, this deficiency is easily treatable. More on vitamin D deficiency: As the name suggests, vitamin D deficiency actually means your body is not having the right level of vitamin D it deserves. Most of you might want to knowwhat is vitamin d test. Well, this test helps you to know the level of vitamin D your body has and if it is running towards a deficiency level. With a lesser vitamin D count, your bones will start to feel weak, along with your muscles. Vitamin D is one prime vitamin that the body uses for normal bone development and proper maintenance. It even plays a major role in the immune system, musculoskeletal system, and nervous system. There are different ways in which your body can get the right amount ofvitamin d levels in bloodas it needs. The first and foremost option is through UV rays. But, people who are older and those with darker skin might not get the right amount of Vitamin D through sunlight. Furthermore, your geographical location will also determine the amount of sunlight your body can get. The next stop is the foods that you eat, through which you will receive the much-needed Vitamin D. There are some nutritional supplements recommended by doctors once you have done through propervitamin d deficiency test, only if your body needs it. The importance that comes with Vitamin D: Your body seriously needs an appropriate amount of Vitamin D to stay fit and healthy. It plays a major role to maintain a proper balance of calcium within your bloodstream and bones and also to maintain it. Specifically, you need proper Vitamin D so that your body can use phosphorus and calcium to build strong bones and also support healthy tissues. Understandwhat is vitamin d testbefore you plan to get one. It will let you know if you are suffering from chronic Vitamin D deficiency. With a chronic deficiency level, there will be a decrease in phosphorus and calcium absorption within your intestines. It can lead to hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency can also causehyperparathyroidism, where the overactive parathyroid gland will try to keep blood calcium levels normal. Both these issues can get severe if your Vitamin D deficiency is not treated on time and can cause some serious symptoms likefatigue, depression, muscle weakness, and cramps. For balancing the calcium levels within your blood, your body will take calcium from bones. It can eventually lead to accelerating bone demineralization. If not treated on time, this situation will result in osteomalacia in adults. Children can suffer from rickets. Osteoporosis and rickets can increase the chances of bone fractures. As a child’s bone is still at its growing stage, demineralization will cause bent or bowed bones. If you want to prevent these issues from hampering your life, then managing propervitamin d levels in bloodis the main clue to consider over here. Who will get highly affected by Vitamin D deficiency? Anyone can be a victim of vitamin D deficiency. So, doctors are always recommending patients move on with avitamin d deficiency testnow. Not just adults, but children and even infants might suffer from the high-end deficiency level right now. This form of deficiency is highly common among people with higher skin melanin content or darker skin. It is also common among those people who tend to wear clothes with high-end skin coverage. Right now, vitamin D deficiency has become a common global phenomenon. Around 1 billion people, worldwide, are suffering from this issue. Around 50% of the world’s population has insufficient vitamin D consumed by their bodies. In the USA, around 35% of adults are victims of vitamin D deficiency nowadays. So, getting proper treatment has become a necessity these days. The signs and symptoms: It is true that you have your answer onwhat is vitamin d test. It shows if you are one of those people suffering from vitamin D deficiency or not. But, even if you don’t take the test before, there are some signs that will help you to know if you might be one such victim. Let’s learn about those symptoms now. Children can suffer from rickets due to vitamin D deficiency. Some of those symptoms among kids are muscle weakness, incorrect growth patterns, pain in the bone, and joint deformities. Children who are suffering from mild deficiency levels might feel weak and sore muscles or painful muscle tissues. Adults will feel fatigued and have bone pain as well if they have lowervitamin d levels in blood. Other than muscle cramps and weakness, some other symptoms of vitamin D deficiency will be mood changes like depression. However, it is not always common to have symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Some people may not face any of the issues mentioned above, but still, end up being a victim of deficiency. That’s why the vitamin D test is vital for all. More about the vitamin D deficiency test: Generally speaking, there are different types of vitamin D deficiency tests available.

Makeup brushes, sponges, and applicators come into direct contact with your face throughout the day, and if not cleaned regularly, can become breeding grounds for bacteria, oil, and residual makeup. This buildup can lead to breakouts, irritation, and even the spread of infection. The good news is that maintaining a hygienic beauty arsenal is a simple process. For brushes, a deep clean every 1-2 weeks is recommended. You can use a gentle brush cleaner, mild dish soap, or a DIY solution of warm water and baby shampoo. Dip the brush head (avoid submerging the metal part) into the solution, swirl the bristles to release makeup, rinse thoroughly, and reshape the brush head while laying it flat to air dry. Cream and liquid products like foundations and concealers are more susceptible to bacteria due to their moist environment. To prevent unwanted microbes, sanitize them with specialized makeup sanitizing sprays containing around 70% alcohol, or create a gentle DIY solution with distilled water and a few drops of tea tree oil. Disposable applicators for mascara and lip gloss are a great way to prevent cross-contamination. Powder-based products like eyeshadows can be refreshed with a light alcohol spritz, but be cautious not to oversaturate them. Finally, don't forget to wipe down the exterior packaging of your makeup products with a gentle disinfectant or mild soap and water to remove external contaminants. By incorporating these simple cleaning routines into your beauty regimen, you can maintain a clean and hygienic makeup kit, promoting healthy skin and ensuring a flawless makeup application every time.",298.0
2024-04-28 15:56:49,Disease_Symptoms,Is The COVID-19 Third Booster Dose Really Safe?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/is-the-covid-19-third-booster-dose-really-safe/,"It has been found that several countries are experiencing a reappearance of Covid-19 driven mainly by thedelta variant of SARS-COV-2. Thus, these countries are in view of the administration of athird booster doseof Covid-19 for addressing the potential fading immunity with time & reduced efficacy against delta variant. A Covid booster dose is an added dose of vaccine given to all individuals after the protection given by the original shot starts declining with time. Thethird vaccine doseindeed helps people in sustaining strong protection from stark coronavirus disease. There is a question that looms large on the minds of the people about the safety of the Covid 19third dose.It is effective in giving protection to people of all age groups that are 5 years and above and severity can be prevented even if a person gets infected with the coronavirus. The number of hospitalization cases has also gone down with thethird booster doseshot. Side effects of a covid booster dose When you get vaccinated with thethird vaccine doseof the Covid-19 vaccine, you will experience similar symptoms to the ones that you experienced after getting a flu vaccine. Symptoms that are common very common include: swollen arm sore throat mild fever headache body ache fatigue for a day or two Swollen lymph and chills can also occur. The above symptoms do not mean that you are sick. It is an indication that your immune system is responding to the vaccine & is building up a guard against Covid-19. A same brand booster dose is not necessary There is a big confusion in the mind of the people taking thethird dosewhether they need to take the booster dose of the same brand as the original dose. Recently, the chief authority has approved a mix and match of brands. Suppose you have taken the original dose of one brand, when it comes to the booster dose, you can take another brand dose. It will not cause any harm and the immunity will be increased to a great extent. The safety concern When it comes to taking thethird vaccine dose,stay assured that it will not have any health issues and is safe to take. It is best to take the booster dose and give a boost to the immunity level that is on the verge of waning after taking the original shots. When an individual completes the vaccination series, protection against the virus starts decreasing with time. Thus, the booster dose is administered to give a boost to immunity. People with comorbidity are highly recommended to take the booster dose. Not only comorbid people but people of all ages above 5 years are recommended to take the booster dose after the original dose. Is a booster dose recommended for all? Athird vaccine dosefor Covid-19 is recommended for people vaccinated already and has a weak immune system. According to the research that receiving a booster dose decrease the infection risk & severe illness from Covid-19. People with moderate and severe debilitated immune systems are highly recommended to get athird booster doseshot of Covid-19. A single booster shot is recommended for people above 5 years after they have taken the initial two doses of covid-19. The booster dose not only boosts the immune system but is a responsible act of the people to protect the family as well as the people surrounding them. Pregnant women can also take the booster dose and no side effects have been found so far. Booster reduces susceptibility to Covid-19 variants Omicronis another variant that is detected globally and to fight this variant, athird booster doseshot has been found to be immensely effective. The emergence of the omicron is a reminder to people globally that people must be careful enough and must practice all covid-19 protocols and should not neglect to take the booster dose. The only way people can fight the pandemic is by wearing a mask and by taking the booster dose. There is no dearth of vaccine availability across the globe. Thus, people should take the vaccine at the earliest if they have crossed the time period after taking the initial doses. Thethird booster doseshot is recommended take after 8months after taking the second dose of Covid-19. It is necessary if any individual wants to achieve protective immunity. People who have received two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine are recommended to go for the booster dose. Thus, the unvaccinated population is at high risk of catching the infection as new variants emerge due to mutation. Gives peace of mind The most asked question among people across the globe is how safe is thethird dose.The booster shot has been found to be absolutely safe and effective. In a recent study by a reputed vaccine manufacturer of Covid-19, it has been published that nearly 10,000 participants took part in a booster trial where half were given a booster and half were given a placebo. As far as safety is concerned, the researchers did not find any adverse effects. It means the result was consistent & with what was found in previous studies. Thus, it can be said that it is completely safe. For people concerned with pericarditis or myocarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, nothing was observed. In fact, it was found that the group received the placebo had a more serious effect than the booster group. How effective is the booster shot? The booster shot is not only safe & effective for theimmunocompromisedbut for the population at large. It has shown immensely effective in boosting the immunity of an individual tocovid-19. If a person had covid-19 & is completely vaccinated, then also the person needs to take the booster dose. The booster dose is found to be protective for that population and also is not at all harmful. The blend of prior Covid-19 infection & receiving the vaccine looks extremely powerful against reinfection with the virus SARS-CoV2. Schedule the booster As already mentioned an individual can take the booster dose right after 8 months from the secondcovid dose.Booster is an added protection for people of all age groups above 5 years. Thus, schedule your booster vaccination in the nearest centre from where you received the initial twodoses. When it comes to taking the booster dose, you must not panic about the dose. The same dose as the first and second dose is given to people across the globe. There is no change in dose. A booster dose gives increased protection to an individual. It has been found that all the vaccines that are given for Covid-19 across the globe are completely safe and the efficacy rate is 95%. This dose is required by all and sundry for getting maximum protection. Risk of getting covid after the booster dose For an individual who got infected with covid 19, there is 99% less chance of reinfection after receiving the booster dose. Here are the facts let’s take a look: After taking the 1stdose, 10% of people got infected After receiving the 2nddose, 4% of individuals caught the infection After taking the 3rddose, 1.5% of people develop the infection.

2024-04-28 15:59:52,science_education,Meet Nazanin Rastegradoost,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/meet-nazanin-rastegradoost,"Nazanin Rastegradoost is a Wireless Communications Specialist with Ofinno. Nazanin shared how her first experiences with astronomy in Tehran, Iran shaped her outlook on STEM and inevitably led her to pursue a career with Ofinno.  Smithsonian Science Education Center: What was your first memorable experience with STEM? Nazanin: When I was in middle school, I was immediately attracted to an after-school astronomy club. We took trips to observatories and deserts throughout Tehran, Iran to watch meteor showers, identify constellations, and learn about the sky. We even built a tent to simulate the night sky and painted various constellations on the fabric. How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Once I was exposed to my schools math center, and with my mom helping me solve equations, I became even more interested in science and math. I went to a great school and learned from top-level instructors, especially in mathematics. I became really interested in geography, which is used frequently in astronomy. We solved these classic geometry theorems that were challenging, but also really fun. They felt like puzzles to me, and I was determined to solve all of them. How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? How did you decide what to pursue for your college major? I was trying to make sense of my life as a teenager. When I was in high school, I snuck a cell phone into school and I started asking questions about how cell phones workedit was pretty basic technology at the time. I wanted to figure out how I could talk to someone remotely at any time without using a wired connection. When I finished high school and started to decide on a college major, I selected electrical engineering because it focused heavily on math and I could study wireless communication. At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? When I started consulting with people about a college major, I observed a friends sister who was a wireless communications engineer. She traveled to different areas to solve peoples problems, and I realized that engineering could use design and math to solve real-world problems to help people. Once I started taking the basic courses for electrical engineering, I was eager to know more. These questions led me to graduate studies and a research career. Graduate school was tough, but it was amazing to see how it changed my professional viewpoints. Seeing myself grow and learn more about solving real-world problems led me to a research career within the industry. Were living in an ever-evolving world, especially within communications. As a wireless specialist, I can see the gaps in our connectivity and develop ideas on how to solve them. Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? I have the best team here at Ofinno, and theyre my main inspiration. My husband and family are proud to see me progress in this area, and their support is important to me. Can you describe your career path that led you to working at Ofinno? The day of my PhD dissertation defense, my professor invited a former student who started his own company. The following day after my defense, he offered me a role as an intern with Ofinno and I accepted. This allowed me to continue what I was studying in my PhD program in a more industrial way. A few months later, I started working as a full-time employee. What does an average day look like for you? My job entails quite a bit of reading and critical thinking about enhancements for projects. My colleagues and I have brainstorming sessions to develop strategies to solve issues within wireless communications. We try to find the most important problem and shape solutions for them in an applicable way for the real world. We patent our ideas and if its adopted, your idea is implemented in the device.

Read theprevious installmentin this blog series here. Margaret Lorimer is an Education Specialist atSolutions in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (STEM Centers SC)and formerly a K-8 mathematics teacher. She has attended and facilitated professional development for fifth grade teachers in South Carolina on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom modulesHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in summer 2021 andHow Can We Identify Materials Based on Their Properties?in summer 2022. We spoke with Margaret in 2021 after virtual professional development to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: What are the benefits to students who are experiencing theSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules taught by trained teachers? Margaret: The kids when the modules are implemented are learning by doing. Theyre digging in and theyre able to interact with the content and to do some sense making of their own so that theyre understanding the concepts better. I think thats really the power of a system that uses these kinds of modules where the students are not just reading about the science, theyre actually interacting with it. Theyre doing experiments, have their hands on it, and have their brains engaged with it. They have opportunities to question and form ideas and then decide whether or not those ideas are viable and then come back around and say, well I dont think thats why this works, lets try it this way. SSEC: How would you describe the differences between the introductory and intermediate 5thgrade training sessions? Margaret: The introductory sessions focused on the content of the module and it was taking a look at the 5thgrade content and the science and engineering processes that were involved in teaching that content. The introductory piece was this is what kids will be doing, this is how kids do this. The intermediate PD was more about the science content knowledge for the teachers, giving them a chance to really dig into some of the science concepts themselves and build their own understanding. I really believe, and my experience has shown me this, that the deeper the teachers content knowledge is, the more flexible they can be in their instruction. They can work with students on their misconceptions and help them build their understanding of the content. SSEC:How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting South Carolina teachers? Margaret:The teachers are coming up with questions that they want to investigate based on the content in the modules that theyre learning. I hope that something like what happened to me happens to them where they go, oh wow, Ive thought this about that particular phenomenon, let me think about why it works the way that it does. I really think that its hard to teach what you havent experienced, I dont think its impossible, but I think that its hard and so if the teachers who have been through this training have fit it into their framework of thinking about science and how they think about science instruction then theyre going to take that in their classrooms and theyre going to give their kids the same opportunities that they had to question their thinking, interact, and learn. As it impacts the teachers, its going to impact the students.  In this screenshot from PD, Margaret facilitates a conversation with teachers. SSEC:How has leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Margaret: When we did the professional development with Smithsonian, the train-the-trainer pieces, all the strategies that we want teachers to use with their kids, were embedded in that PD, so we experience the strategies as learners and then we want the teachers to take those. We want the folks who experienced those strategies that were embedded in that PD to then take it and use it with their students. For example, a lot of times when you think about your own instruction in science, when you were a learner, when you were a student, you get this list of vocabulary words and you find out what all the definitions of the vocabulary words are and then you do the learning about the science thats attached to the vocabulary words. But really, its better to have an experience that [the] vocabulary is embedded in and you have to use it to have the experience. Then at the back end you talk about the meanings of the words. That was embedded in the intermediate piece: that teaching strategy was introduced to them and they were encouraged to apply that to other science instruction. SSEC:What is the impact of this for you and how do you see this potentially changing science and STEM education? Margaret: People will not do what they have not experienced themselves. If the only science instruction theyve ever experienced is show and tell where I do it as the teacher, we do a few things together, and then you go and do some stuff on your own for practice, if thats all theyve ever experienced, thats how theyre going to teach. That makes perfect sense because we do what weve been taught to do, so having training like this that is based in inquiry, that is built around the science and engineering practices, if they experience it as learners, then they are much more likely to carry it into their classrooms and do it that way with their students. The strength of programs like theSmithsonian Science for the Classroomis the teacher support pieces. If Im a K-5 teacher and Im not real sure about my content, then Im going stick with whatever the textbook tells me to do, but if I have a Smithsonian module and Ive learned how to use it, then the teacher supports that are built into that make it much easier for me to take the risk to do science a little differently with my students, so thats where the power to make change comes in.",1009.0

2024-04-28 15:57:00,Disease_Symptoms,5 Important Facts about My Genetic Test,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/5-important-facts-about-my-genetic-test/,"A lot has changed in the last couple of years when it comes to DNA testing. Some of you might not even knowwhat is genetic test. Well, it is one way to now test for over 100 diseases before pregnancy or you get to predict cancer before even it starts to develop in your body. Right now, researchers are using the power of DNA testing to target medication responses better for various conditions. With so manytypes of genetic testingavailable, you might sometime wonder if going for this test is suitable for you or not. There are some important facts for you to consider as you start navigating through the world of genetic or DNA testing. 1. Get to learn more about your family history A thorough grasp of the family history will always offer you some clues regarding the kind of testing that can benefit you the most. The propergenetic analysis testhelps in encouraging the family health history among men and women. It helps to determine if the health issues like any form of cancer even run in your family. In case they do, then generic counseling and testing will offer a better understanding of the risks that you might be facing and what to do about them. When you are gathering clues, be sure to see if there are heart diseases, cancer patterns, or other illnesses available to run through generations. Recognizing the inherited disease pattern can help the whole family. After you learnwhat is genetic test, you will realize the importance of looking into history on both sides of your family. 2. Pretty affordable and also covered by medical insurance plans Just a few years back, getting one of anytypes of genetic testingcan cost you a lot of money. But, thanks to advances taking place in DNA technologies, now you can get the test done at reduced rates. Laboratories are now offering DNA tests for the larger panels of genetic diseases. Furthermore, there are different insurance plans that will understand the major values of genetic testing and helps to prevent the onset of disease. These plans will offer the ultimate coverage for all the qualifying individuals. 3. Genetic counselors to help navigate the results Well, genetic counselors are mainly experts who are the main decision-makers aroundgenetic analysis test. They understand that every person has their set of life goals, values, and experiences. The current decision to go for genetic screening will involve multiple factors. It is quite helpful to have a direct chat about the pros and cons of such tests with a genetic counselor. The main goal of this discussion is to determine whether a screening test is a right option for you to consider. Some of the questions that might arise over here will include the reasons why you want the information, ways you are planning to take it to family members regarding implications, what you are planning to do with the results, and so on. In case you fail to visit a genetic counselor face to face, some labs will offer free telephone access to some of the board-certified professionals. With proper counseling, you will feel it easier to understand the DNA results and that helps you to make some informed health choices as well. 4. Carriers of the genetic diseases are mostly healthy You can always target those carriers as healthy individuals, who carry genetic diseases. Based on the kind of disease involved, a carrier can be healthy himself but unfortunately pass the disease to future generations, such as spinal muscular atrophy and cystic fibrosis. Once you have your answers resolved onwhat is genetic test, you will come to know its importance. In the case of some cancer types like hereditary colon cancer, the carrier seems to be prone to develop cancer during the early stages of life and then pass on propensity. Some of you might be a carrier of various rare diseases and you are not even aware of it unless you get tested. So, understand thetypes of genetic testingfirst and then go for the right one. If you have recessive diseases, then you might skip some generations. So, you are not sure if you are infected or not. For any kind of recessive disease to deal with, it is vital for both parents to carry the same rare gene. At some point, people would choose to not go for carrier screening as they don’t have a concerning history behind the family. But, you must know that around 80% of children, if not more, who are born with genetic diseases are both to those parents without any history of that disease in the family. 5. Using results to plan right ahead There are different times in life when agenetic analysis testwill help you to plan ahead and that helps in saving your life, especially if you have cancer running in your family. During pregnancy screening, a carrier screen will be performed on blood samples or saliva for both you and also your partner. That provides some useful ideas before conceiving. Over 100 rare yet significant genetic diseases will be added within the carrier screening like Hurler syndrome, Spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis, and even Wilson’s disease. Some such diseases on the carrier screening panel can get improved through some early interventions. It is because nutritional changes at birth can provide some value-added results later in life. So, it is not hard to state that understanding the risks through genetic testing, ahead of time, will give you ample time to prepare for the safety gear. You can start medications early or make changes in your diet plan to keep the disease at bay. Get the test done from Remedies Labs You need a proper diagnostic center from where you can get the DNA testing done.

2024-04-28 16:00:07,science_education,My Personal Recommendations for Ways to Create an Inclusive Environment for Students With Disabilities by Yujia Ding,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/my-personal-recommendations-ways-create-inclusive-environment-students-disabilities,"Creating an inclusive environment is something that I strive for. Not only do I work towards making sure my classroom is a safe place, but I also work to make sure that if any student wants to perform an experiment or participate in an activity, they can perform that activity as best they can. The following recommendations are based on personal observations and experiences as well as, suggestions Ive received from friends and students with disabilities. I offer them as a way to start to engage students with disabilities and create a more inclusive learning space: Ask your student what works for them instead of assuming. Each student is different and unique; and every individual that identifies with disabilities is different. Even if they both are visually impaired, for instance, their needs and accommodations are going to differ and as an educator, one should not assume. Rather, speak with the student. Ask the student what their needs are. Ask the student what works for them and what doesnt. Invite your student to participate in how accommodations in the IEP are implemented. The conversation of accommodations and accessibility is an ongoing one. The conversation doesnt stop with the first day of school IEP meeting. Even if you get the IEP at the beginning of the school year, ensure that you speak with the student to know what works for your subject and your classroom space. While each teacher receives the same accommodations list for a particular student, the way those accommodations are applied in a biology class versus an English class may not be the same. Make sure that the accommodations are serving the student to support their learning at the same level and rigor as the rest of the class, not to use the accommodations to make the assignment or task easier to accomplish. Allow every student a chance to participate in classroom activities. Dont assume that your student can or cannot do something because of their disability. Give everyone a chance. Let the students try and try again. I always tell my students that failure is not the end of the road. Failure or the word fail, means First Attempt In Learning. I always ensure my students know that they have chances to succeed. As the teacher in the room, I make sure that the students learn from each attempt and are constantly improving. Having a growth mindset not only helps my students with ensuring they are challenging themselves and gaining new skills, it also helps me as the educator learn what works for different needs and then be able to call on those experiences when helping a future student. Try new things. Be innovative. Dont live inside a box. If the standard or commonly accepted solution doesnt work for one student, keep working with them to find something that will work. Think creatively. Because I have a disability, I realize how important it is to recognize the person first, because it is not the only thing that defines me. I am an individual with a disability, not a disabled individual. That is why I always strive to hold my students to the same rigor and expectations regardless of the differences among them. I help them pursue their passions and if modifications are needed along the way to ensure equity, work together as a team to ensure that can happen.",561.0

Gone are the days of rigid conformity and limited silhouettes. Today's menswear embraces individuality, experimentation, and a willingness to challenge traditional notions of masculinity. This newfound freedom allows men to express their unique personalities through their clothing choices, blurring the lines between classic and contemporary, formal and casual. One of the most significant shifts is the rise of gender-fluid fashion. Masculinity is no longer defined by a narrow set of clothing styles. Men are embracing traditionally ""feminine"" elements like floral prints, pastel colors, and flowing silhouettes. This isn't about losing masculinity; it's about expanding its definition. It's about confidence in expressing yourself authentically, regardless of societal expectations. Comfort takes center stage in contemporary menswear. Tailored suits still hold a place for formal occasions, but they've become more relaxed in their fit. Think slimmer cuts without sacrificing movement, and the incorporation of comfortable fabrics like stretch cotton and linen blends. Athleisure continues to influence everyday wear, with joggers and hoodies taking their place alongside jeans and chinos. The key here is achieving a balance  blending comfort with a touch of sophistication. Sustainability is making its mark on men's fashion as well. Eco-conscious consumers are opting for brands that prioritize recycled materials, organic fabrics, and responsible production practices. Choosing ethically sourced clothing allows men to make a statement about their values while looking sharp. The new era of men's fashion celebrates individuality and self-expression. It's about breaking free from rigid expectations and embracing a more fluid and diverse approach to style. Whether it's a classic suit with a modern twist, a bold statement piece, or a comfortable yet stylish casual outfit, men's fashion allows room for personal exploration and the freedom to define your own sense of style.",390.0
2024-04-28 15:57:08,Disease_Symptoms,7 Things to Know about Annual Health Check up,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/7-things-to-know-about-annual-health-check-up/,"The health and well-being of your body are a top priority. This makes it necessary to scheduleannual health check upwith your physician, like the regularly scheduled maintenance on your car, truck, etc. It is essential to get regular checkups for overall good health. 1. Why are Annual health checkups important? Annual health checksare recommended for people of all ages. They can identify and prevent health conditions before they become severe and in the early stages of diagnosis or treatment. It is also important to realize thatannual health checkupsare not a ‘one and done’ visit with your doctor. They alert any potential problems or issues, which means you should be regularly checking your physical and mental health to see how well you are coping. 2. What is the right time to start taking Annual Health checkups? Annual checkups make sure that your body is healthy and can do all the things you want it to. It’s like taking your car in for an oil change every time you need gas. Even when you are in your teens and twenties, anannual health check upis essential for taking good care of yourself. Your primary doctor or family doctor may be the first to recommend a yearly medical evaluation. 3. When to take Annual Health check up? People above 40 years of age should go for acomplete body checkupevery year because these people are at risk of gettingheart attacks or diabetes. They also have many other health problems due to their age and should be cautious about their health. 4. What are measures to follow before taking a health checkup? To make the most of yourannual health check upand also to get the maximum benefit from it, you should follow these measures: Do not rush for ageneral health checkupin a hurry; always plan a month before. Go through your records carefully. For better understanding and treatment, try to record all the symptoms you have been suffering from since lastyear’s checkup. Check your family history forhereditary diseases. Before getting your health checkup done, you must follow specific guidelines and precautions to ensure that you get accurate results in your tests. Do not eat anything or drink anything after 8 hours before the test. The doctor might ask you to eat something before the test, depending on what tests he will perform, butblood testsusually require an empty stomach. Do not consume any alcohol at least 24 hours before the test. This will affect many of the tests and give false results. 5. Types of medical checkups There are a few things that change as you get older. Here are some of the checkups and exams you should consider getting once you turn 18. Annual physical: Your doctor will check your blood pressure and heart rate and listen to your lungs and heart. They will also perform a simple exam of your head and neck, abdomen, ears, eyes, nose, throat, and skin. Pap test:The Pap test checks for any abnormal cells on your cervix, which could eventually turn into cervical cancer. Pelvic exam (women):This exam checks for problems with your reproductive system like ovarian cysts or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Mammogram:The mammogram is an X-ray of the breast that can help detect breast cancer earlier than a routine physical exam because it can see through the tissue layers in your breasts. Bone density scan:Bone density tests(also called bone mineral density tests or BMD tests) check how strong your bones are. Examine your heart and lungs:These tests are performed to know the functionality. Prostate exam (men):The exam typically involves a digital rectal exam (DRE) and a test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Blood pressure measurement, Body mass index (BMI) calculation, Height and weight measurement, Heart rate measurement, Waist circumference measurement, etc., are some of the exams to be included. 6. Do’s and Don’ts Prepare for the appointment by writing down all your symptoms, questions, and concerns. Bring a list of medications you’re currently taking. Make sure you have your insurance information with you. Write down any questions that come up right after the appointment, so you can remember them when your doctor calls with test results. Do not eat a heavy meal before your appointment. Go on an empty stomach, or have only a light breakfast or lunch before visiting the doctor. Do not drink too much liquid hours before your appointment. This can make it difficult for doctors to get an accurate reading of your blood pressure, as consuming excess liquid can cause misleading spikes in blood pressure. Do not exercise vigorously hours before your appointment. If you show up to the doctor’s office sweaty and out of breath, they may have trouble taking your pulse or reading your heart rate and blood pressure. Do not wear tight clothing that is constricting; this can interfere with the physical exam since your doctor will need to be able to check for lumps in different areas of the body. 7. How annual medical checkups benefits Scheduling ayearly health checkuphelps you stay aware of your body and stay on top of any warning signs that you are experiencing. Some more benefits are discussed below: Healthcare Expenditure is reduced:An early diagnosis of any disease helps in reducing the expenditure on healthcare and reduces the treatment period. Hidden Diseases are diagnosed:It is common to visit a doctor only when you experience symptoms of any disease. But many underlying diseases do not show any symptoms during the early stages and can only be detected by undergoingblood testsperiodically. In such cases, health checkups help find hidden diseases with blood tests such asblood sugar level, cholesterol level, liver functioning, kidney functioning, etc. Nips in the Bud:By undertakingregular health checkups, you can find out if any abnormalities in your body might develop into serious diseases if ignored for long periods. This will enable you to nip it in the bud before it develops into something serious. Identifies Diseases Related to Stress:The current lifestyle leads to stress-related diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which often go unnoticed until serious complications arise due to a lack of proper diagnosis at their early stages. Health checkups undertaken periodically will help identify stress-related diseases and take preventive measures accordingly. Creates Awareness of Your Health Status:If you undergo health checkups periodically, you will have a good idea about your health status. In today’s world, where the number of diseases and healthcare costs are shooting up all the time, getting a complete annual health check for yourself and your family will save you a lot of money and possible pain in the future.

SSEC: How did you feel after finding out you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? JJ:We were told by our curriculum instructional administrator that this was a really great program. We were excited and (still are) to do the professional development with the Smithsonian Science Education Center. Energy is such a big part of our curriculum in North Carolina for 4th grade, so it was really cool that something that we teach was made into something broader with the information that we were given through the Smithsonian. The books and additional material really go in-depth into energy, batteries, electricity, and all things that are important for energy. {The professional development allows them to have a deep dive of the lesson}. These are things that we would love to teach our kids, but we may not always have the opportunity to, whether its a time crunch or the way that the material was laid out. Its a good indicator of hey, we can get this done. We had a few teachers who had been through a similar program a few years ago, so we had a little bit of background of what to expect. Our administrators and those who had taken courses in the past from the Smithsonian thought they were great. It was really impactful to see how this was going to be useful in the classroom. What would you describe as the most impactful moment for you during your professional development? There was a really big lightbulb moment on day two that we realized all of the different lessons were connected intricately and built upon each other. It started at a primary level by using basic knowledge that kids were already coming to the table with, and then increased the knowledge base. You couldnt do lesson 3 without doing lesson 2 and I really enjoyed seeing that aspect. Oftentimes we have curriculum that diverges here and there, so we constantly feel like we have to do extra research or extra activities to fill in gaps. The [Smithsonian Science for the Classroom] had no gaps and went further in-depth of the knowledge base that the kids should already know. Even if the student didnt understand it the first time around, they were definitely going to on the second trytheres a constant spiraling review of the whole process that uses the same science content language.  In this screenshot from PD, JJ and others view the Carolina Science Online interface. In your experience, how has this curriculum differed from ones you might have taught in the past? Theres a lot of project-based learning that we went through with Smithsonian Science for the Classroom. It seemed like almost all of the lessons we went over included an experiment with reasoning and observations instead of just presenting information in a textbook. It provided resources and let the students investigate different approaches to science, which was really cool. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Its easy for me, and I have to catch myselfnot to just give them the answer. Its really been eye opening for me to realize that the kids just need to use that deductive reasoning and that theyve got to do this on their own. Im quick to just give them hints to lead them in the right direction for time's sake, but Im realizing that so much of the lesson builds off the previous that if I didnt get it all in during a 45-minute session that theres always tomorrow. They really enjoy it, and it really challenges me too. What was it like for you to meet other teachers who were becoming acclimated to Smithsonian Science for the Classroom? It was great to have that collaboration and to see things that worked in different situations. We often had discussions about remote learners versus in-class learners and some of the strategies they were using.",850.0

It allows you to play with textures, colors, and proportions, adding depth and dimension to your look. Mastering the art of layering is all about creating a cohesive and balanced ensemble, one that complements your body type and flatters your silhouette. Start with a foundation  a basic tee, a fitted tank top, or a turtleneck. This forms the base layer, providing a starting point for building your outfit. The next layer offers opportunities for exploration. Experiment with button-down shirts, sweaters, vests, or kimonos. Choose pieces that complement the base layer  a fitted shirt over a loose tee for visual contrast, or a lightweight kimono over a tank top for a relaxed yet stylish vibe. Texture plays a crucial role in successful layering. Combine smooth fabrics like silk or satin with chunky knits or textured linens to create a visually engaging interplay. Don't be afraid to experiment with patterns! Stripes and florals can add personality when paired with solid-colored pieces. Remember, balance is key  a busy patterned shirt might work best with a simpler bottom layer. The bottom layer offers another opportunity for creative expression. Jeans, chinos, skirts, or dresses can all be utilized in layering. Tucking a shirt into high-waisted pants creates a defined waistline, while letting a longer shirt hang loose over a skirt adds a casual touch. When layering multiple garments, consider proportions. Balance a bulkier top with slimmer bottoms, or pair a flowy dress with a fitted jacket. Accessories are the finishing touch when it comes to layered looks. A statement necklace can elevate a simple outfit, while a chunky scarf adds warmth and texture. For colder weather, layer on a beanie or a fedora hat, and complete the look with a pair of stylish boots. Layering opens a world of possibilities for expressing your personal style, allowing you to create unique and fashionable looks for any occasion.",328.0
2024-04-28 15:57:11,Disease_Symptoms,How a Complete Blood Test Can Help You Improve Your Health?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/how-a-complete-blood-test-can-help-you-improve-your-health/,"Did you know that an easy blood test can reveal more about your health than most doctors? The blood tests your doctor orders are vital to the diagnosis. Your lab results allow physicians to evaluate organ function and detect any blood-borne diseases or abnormalities. Learn all about thecomplete blood count(CBC) here. What is the Complete Blood Count (CBC) Test? A complete blood count (CBC) is ablood testthat checks for changes in the blood. It gives information about the types and numbers of cells in your blood. The test will measure the number of Red blood cells White blood cells and Platelets present in your bloodstream These three components play important roles in different functions in your body. If any of them is within normal ranges, the corresponding function will be handled efficiently. Low or high counts of these cells indicate a dysfunction or disease. A CBC also shows how well your bone marrow produces healthy blood cells. Everyone has these cells, but certain changes in their numbers can indicate a health problem. What is it used for? The CBC is used to test severaldifferent types of anemia. It can be used to monitor specific conditions such as cancer and heart failure. Hemoglobin levels, or red blood cell count, are also tested to see if the body has enough healthyred blood cells. Platelet levels are also checked to see if there is an adequate level of platelets being produced by the bone marrow. Why do I need a complete blood count? If you have signs or symptoms of infection, your doctor may order a CBC as part of a routine physical exam. It may be ordered if you are being tested for other liver function problems or kidney function problems. A complete blood count is also ordered when you have symptoms that suggest a problem with your blood or if you have a condition that affects your blood cells (such as sickle cell disease). What happens during a Complete Blood Count test? As a part of the procedure, performed by qualifiedphlebotomists or lab techniciansdraw required blood from the superficial veins of the upper arm using a syringe and transfer it to a test tube or a vial. The specimen will then be sent to the lab for analysis. The amount of blood taken depends on how many tests you’re having done, but it’s usually about 1mL to 3mL. In most cases, you do not need to fast before having this test done. You may eat or drink normally before the test. However, it is advised to drink plenty of water before your appointment. When you’re hydrated, your blood volume goes up, and your veins are plumper and easier to access. The purpose of a Complete Blood Count For overall health assessment of the patient: It is often recommended as part of a complete medical examination to obtain a CBC to get a complete picture of a patient’s health. This will help your doctor identify any potential health issues you may have. Diagnose medical conditions: If you are ill, your doctor will perform a CBC to determine the cause or etiology of your illness and determine yourWBC count. . Typically, this is done when the patient is experiencing symptoms of fatigue, fever, weakness, or even internal bleeding. Monitoring a medical treatment’s effectiveness: A CBC can only be used to monitor specific treatments. Counting your blood cells and white blood cells (RBCs & WBCs) allows the doctors to monitor how well the treatment works. To monitor your health: If you suffer from a medical condition that affects your blood, your doctor may recommend a CBC test to check your blood cell count. Your doctor may prescribe medication or dietary changes to manage the condition. What does a CBC measure? Thecomplete blood count (CBC)is one of the most common tests performed in a doctor’s office or hospital. It measuresred and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cell and carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues. Your body’s amount of red blood cells depends on your age and sex. This test measures your level of red blood cells. White blood cells are essential for fighting infections, protecting against disease, and healing wounds. There are five different types of white blood cells:neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. You can determine how many white blood cells you have by taking this test. Platelets help prevent bleeding by forming clots at sites where vessels have been injured or damaged. If you lose too many platelets, you could bleed excessively after an injury or surgery. This test measures how many platelets you have per microliter of blood (microliters). Hemoglobin is the protein in your blood that holds oxygen. The test determines the Hb level of the patient and the HbA1C level of blood glucose to determine if the patient is not suffering from pre-diabetes. A red blood cell scale is used to measure the size of the RBC. The size of these cells provides significant information about the patient’s medical condition. A high MCV indicates low folate orvitamin B12levels if your cells are larger than usual. If the size is smaller, this may be a sign of anemia. A doctor can determine how many red cells are present in your blood by measuring this. Low percentages may indicate iron deficiency. The mineral iron is responsible for thered blood cell count. However, if your score is high, you may be dehydrated or suffering from another condition or disorder. What does the result indicate? CBCs measure the number of cells in your blood. If your counts are not within normal ranges, there may be several reasons. These include: Hematocrit or red blood cell levels that are abnormal can be signs ofanemia, heart disease, or low iron levels. White cell count may be low due to certainautoimmune disorders, bone marrow disorders, or cancer. A high white blood cell count could result from an infection or an adverse reaction to medicine. When your levels are abnormal, it does not always mean you have a medical problem that requires treatment. Diet, activity level, medicine, menstruation, and not drinking enough water can affect the results. CBCS is useful for evaluating an individual’s overall health. CBCs are associated with very low or no risks. There is only one procedure that involves taking a blood sample from the patient. By the results of this blood test, the next phase of treatment can be determined. Present in 9 locations across 8 major cities in India,  Dr. Remedies Labs offersCompleteBlood Count testsas a part of its various packages at affordable prices. On taking an appointment, qualified phlebotomists will visit your residence or office to collect the samples and revert with the reports by email.

2024-04-28 16:00:11,science_education,Meet Hyoungsuk Jeon,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/meet-hyoungsuk-jeon,"Hyoungsuk Jeon is an Inventor, Radio Technologies and Research Manager with Ofinno. His curiosity about problem solving and engineering started at a young age with the help of a toy car gifted by his grandfather. As his passions grew, he moved from South Korea to America to pursue more advanced academic and career opportunities that aligned with his goals. Hyoungsuk spoke with the Smithsonian Science Education Center about his engineering career journey.  What was your first memorable experience with STEM? When I was 6 years old, my grandfather gifted me a small toy car. He said it would be more interesting if we disassembled the toy and figured out a way to reconstruct it together. I was a small child at the time and didnt have a full understanding of what that meant. All of a sudden, my grandfather disassembled the toy. There were plastic pieces and springs everywhere, and I was curious about how he was going to rebuild the toy. When I look back on that experience, that was my first lesson in reverse engineering. I learned that if I deconstruct a device or a machine, I can understand how it works. My grandfather wanted to show me the methods of how everyday objects operate, so I took that influential experience with me as I grew older and began to examine the details of how other things work.  How were you able to nurture your interests throughout middle and high school? Art and math were major influences of my current career path. I really enjoyed still-life painting and drawing because you have to observe a subject in great detail. I may imagine the color and shape of something, but when I actually analyzed it thoroughly, those details were different. Those observation skills are beneficial because Im now able to view subjects in an objective way instead of subjective. I also enjoyed the problem-solving skills necessary to complete advanced math equations. I had a math workbook and solved all of the problems on my own one summer during middle school. Refining those observation and problem-solving skills were a great foundation for me in engineering.  How did your teachers, mentors, or family members help you pursue your interests? My parents let me explore different subjects and supported those interests by sending me to enrichment programs like art classes, for example. They didnt push me into pursuing one subject over another, they allowed me to navigate things as I grew. Another influential person was my best friend who passed away when he was 20 years old. We had been friends since we were 8 years old, and we started having philosophical conversations in our teenage years. I feel like my personality and character started to develop during that period. He was the type of person who supported and encouraged people deeply, and he encouraged me to go to engineering school.  At what point did you realize that you could turn your passions into a career? In electrical engineering there are a variety of specialties. I was interested in the theoretical part because it involved so many math equations. I fell in love with solving open issues, but they were time intensive. I had my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the time, but it wasnt enough for me to work on more advanced issues. I decided to move to America to pursue my masters, Ph.D, and postdoctoral program. In South Korea, there were many opportunities for me to become a pure researcher to solve mathematical problems. But in the United States, there are more requirements for a theoretical skillset. I wanted to see how the problems I solved influenced people and the world. I found a job that allowed me to cultivate that skillset here at Ofinno.  Did you encounter any barriers to pursuing your STEM goals? When I was 18, I felt like Id lost my way and began to question my career path. In my early 20s I eventually decided to pursue engineering. I was interested in the theoretical part of electrical engineering and wanted to have a more practical skill set and thats why I did my post-doc in America.  Is there anyone that currently inspires you to continue working in this particular field? My parents always inspire me. In South Korea, my parents experienced the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War. They were born into a wealthy family, but after the war, all of their property was gone. Those were difficult times for my parents and they always told us about the circumstances they worked to overcome. I realized how incredibly smart my parents were to navigate ways to survive under such harsh conditions. Learning about their sacrifices always motivates me to work hard and overcome barriers.  Can you describe your career path that led you to work at Ofinno? After moving to America, my first job was as an engineer and I worked to resolve wireless communication problems. It was a fun job for me and allowed me to gain more practical experience in my career. I wanted to have more collaboration and communication with colleagues in upper management teams. That motivated me to find a smaller company so that I could have more influence within the production process. Ofinno was a good fit for me because it allowed me to have an impact. Im able to be involved from the beginning to the end of an inventions project management, including working with attorneys to have the invention patented.  ",914.0

2024-04-28 15:57:15,Disease_Symptoms,What is the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Test?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/what-is-the-thyroid-stimulating-hormone-test/,"Although you have the same habits, your weight has changed significantly; you always feel tired. You are always hot or cold but never comfortable. You did not have a regular period, but you are not pregnant, you have a bump on your neck. If you experience any of these symptoms, it may be time for you to be checked with aThyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) test. What is TSH? TheTSH testis a blood test that measures the level of TSH in your blood. The pituitary gland in your brain makes a hormone calledthyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the production of TSH by the pituitary gland. This hormone tells the thyroid gland whether to speed up or slow down its production of T3 and T4. TSH is released into the bloodstream, where it travels throughout your body, stimulating the growth and activity of thyroid cells in your thyroid gland. When too little thyroid hormone is in your body, your pituitary gland will produce more TSH. Conversely, if too much thyroid hormone is present in your body, your pituitary gland will produce less TSH. What does a TSH test measure? A TSH test measures how well your pituitary gland works by measuring how much TSH it releases into your bloodstream. What is the purpose of the TSH test? The primary purpose of this test is to help diagnose certain conditions such as: hyperthyroidism (too much thyroid hormone) hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone) Hashimoto’s disease (an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack the thyroid gland) Goiter Thyroid cancer Why should I get a TSH test? It may be beneficial for you to undergo this test if you have symptoms of thyroid disorders, such as weight changes, fatigue, feeling hot all the time (even if others around you are feeling cold), dry skin, hair loss, irregular periods, depression, and anxiety, constipation, and hoarseness. These symptoms are not always caused by an underactive or overactive thyroid gland, so other tests may be needed before any treatment can be started. How does the TSH test work? TheThyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) testmeasures the level of this hormone in the blood. TSH is released by the pituitary gland, which is located at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland produces TSH in response to signals from the hypothalamus and the thyroid gland. The hypothalamus is a small structure in the brain that plays a vital role in regulating body temperature, hunger, thirst, and emotions such as fear and anger. It also sends hormones to the pituitary gland to stimulate or inhibit its production of TSH. The thyroid gland produces two hormones: T3 and T4 (thyroxine). These hormones are essential for normal development in children’s normal metabolism, growth, and development. If you have low levels of T4 or T3 in your blood, this could mean that your thyroid isn’t working correctly. This test aims to find out if you have abnormal levels of these hormones; your doctor will want to check your TSH levels regularly to ensure they don’t get too high or low. Taking certain medications like levothyroxine (Levothroid), methimazole (Tapazole), and propylthiour also affect how well your pituitary gland functions. What should you do to prepare for the test? Before having this blood test, tell your healthcare provider about any medications you are taking because some medications may affect the test results. Also, tell your health care provider if you have an iodine allergy or have ever had a reaction to an iodine contrast agent used for x-rays or CT scans. You may need to stop taking certain medications before your TSH test. These include: Birth control pills Estrogen supplements (including hormone replacement therapy) Corticosteroids (for example, prednisone) Thyroid medications (levothyroxine) Is there any risk involved in the test? There is no risk involved in having this blood test. How can the results be interpreted? Normal values for TSH range from 0.5 to 3 mill units per liter (mU/L). However, there’s no single answer for what constitutes normal TSH levels. Your doctor will use your results and other information to determine whether your thyroid is underactive or overactive. For example: Suppose your TSH level is below 0.5 mU/L, but other hormones are within the normal range. In that case, you may have subclinical hypothyroidism (low thyroid function) or Hashimoto’s disease (an autoimmune disorder that causes thyroid inflammation). In these cases, treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone may be needed to bring your levels back into balance. If your TSH level is between 4 and 10 mU/L, but all other hormones are within the normal range, you may have normal thyroid function with a slight increase in antibodies in your bloodstream. What else should you know about a TSH test? Regarding thyroid health, knowing how much of each hormone you have circulating through your bloodstream at any given time is essential. The thyroid gland also needs iodine to produce these hormones. Iodine is found naturally in foods such as milk, eggs, and seafood. Iodized salt contains added iodine to ensure that people get enough of this mineral daily. When your thyroid produces too much or too little TSH, it can harm your metabolism — increasing or decreasing your body’s ability to make energy from food sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. From a practical standpoint, the biggest draw of TSH testing is that it’s convenient. It’s fast and easy, and most people have no problem with it. However, because there are other thyroid function tests available, you should discuss with your doctor which test(s) will give you the best idea of what’s going on with your body. The TSH test can serve as an avenue to finding out where things stand concerning your thyroid levels without having to go through any hassle or spend thousands of dollars. If you develop any of the above-discussed symptoms and demand answers immediately, consult Dr. Remedies Labs to take a thyroid profile test.

2024-04-28 16:00:15,science_education,Adapting to Change: Benefits of Inquiry-Based Science Education for Students and Teachers,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/adapting-change-benefits-inquiry-based-science-education-students-and-teachers,"In October of 2019, the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) was awarded an early-phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR) grantfrom the U.S. Department of Education. We were excited to begin our project providing Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and professional development to teachers. How could we have predicted that mere months later a global pandemic would wreak havoc on classroom learning worldwide? When schools abruptly and indefinitely closed their doors in March 2020, our project bringing inquiry-based science curriculum to third, fourthand fifth-grade students in rural North and South Carolina was turned upside down, along with everything else. Our best-laid plans to understand howSmithsonian Science for the Classroomcurriculum and robust professional development (PD) impact student achievement in science, math, and reading suddenly seemed like a far-off dream. When we finally launched our first workshop in the spring of 2021, it was with renewed purpose to combat learning loss and build connections.  The PD we held in March 2021 was completely reimagined for our new normal of online convenings, and much different from the big kick-off in-person introduction we had planned. Teachers were, understandably, swamped trying to serve students who might be in the classroom one day and at home the next. Despite these challenges, weve seen teachers confidence in their science instruction grow over the past three years, first in the virtual environment and then when we resumed in-person PD. Does change like this happen overnight? Absolutely not! But just as our workshops have evolved to meet changing needs, so have teachers attitudes. By our last PD in summer 2023, we received positive feedback from teachers and participants in the program, WOW! I was so engaged in these PD lessons and feel more empowered to take on instruction on these new 4th grade science standards. At the start of our most recent Content and Pedagogy Professional Development, we asked teachers when they last took a chemistry or physics class. Some couldnt remember if they ever took one, while others mentioned a class 10+ years ago. Although there was some apprehension about not being subject-matter experts, teachers asked questions, shared their classroom knowledge and werent afraid to be vulnerable. During the workshop, teachers participated in activities and simulations to address misconceptions and explore different teaching strategies. By the end of our two days together, teachers felt energized and confident in themselves and their ability to guide learning alongside their students.  To better understand the effect on students, our third-party evaluator, the Center for Research in Educational Policy (CREP) at the University of Memphis, is currently analyzing student assessment data. We eagerly await a better understanding of the impact of Smithsonian Science for the Classroom curriculum and accompanying professional development on student achievement in science, math and reading. While were excited the preliminary analysis is very positive, the project has bolstered more than students scores. Weve seen teachers attitudes and confidence related to science learning and instruction bloom and directly translate to students excitement about science. The curriculum is very engaging to the students. They love the hands-on activities, they take leadership while working in groups, theyre pulled into discovery and the joy of the discovery when they do the experiments, said Andrea Walter from Polk Central Elementary School. They also enjoy the reading selections because it brings a global perspective to their lives and they make connections to what theyre learning in social studies. While the Smithsonian Science Education Center and our incredible collaborators might not have known what was in store when awarded the grant in 2019, we have made the most of the opportunity to serve teachers and students in rural districts across North and South Carolina. The fact that all 37 of the schools who first signed on to participate have remained in the project is a testament to their tenacity and resilience as much as it is the resources we have to offer. We look forward to sharing more with supporters after the official publication of the analysis and, until then, continue to showcase the holistic benefits of inquiry-based science education on student outcomes.",678.0

2024-04-28 15:57:18,Disease_Symptoms,What are pathology tests?,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/what-are-pathology-tests/,"Pathologyis a surgical subspecialty, also known as the study of diseases or specific diseases; it is a field of medicine most often associated with the diagnosis and study of diseases such as cancer. More generally, pathology is the study of changes in an organism caused by disease, the normal and abnormal structure, function, and behavior of living systems. Pathology testsare used to diagnose disease. They help reveal the actual cause of specific diseases likeautism, cancer, Crohn’s, and dementia. They can show you problems in the body but treat them by treating the symptoms. Pathology tests simulate what happens to your body when you suffer from a specific disease. Tests are done on the cells of the specific organ in question, and the results help doctors get more information about that particular disease. Various pathology tests: Pathology tests are meant to determine if there is a specific disease or combination of diseases. They differ based on a few diseases and specific criteria for diagnosis. When you get asked by your doctor which test is required for your condition, you will know the difference in pathology testing. These criteria can be found in other medical conditions as well. Unlike lab tests, pathology tests are typically carried out atpathology laboratories, and doctors often have no idea what the results mean. Pathologies have to be diagnosed and the results interpreted first before one expects the final results of such an audiovisual testing program. There are many ways to diagnose a medical condition. The test that is used depends on what we are looking for and how serious the condition is. There are manydifferent types of pathology tests, but they all fall into one of three categories: 1. Blood, urine, and saliva tests (known as “serum” tests) 2. Imaging scans (such as X-rays and ultrasounds) 3. Biopsy samples (tissue samples taken from inside the body) There are two ways to help diagnose more medical conditions. 1. Physical examand a complete medical history, which can be found in most doctor’s offices. Not all doctors offer this type of diagnostic procedure, so it is up to the patient to find one they do. 2. Clinical tests:A clinical test checks blood, urine, or other body fluids for changes in levels of certain chemicals or vitamins, which can indicate disease processes. This type of test requires many hours of work by technicians and can often seem pointless unless the results indicate a significant change in health status. Why are these tests necessary? Pathology tests are a big part of healthcare. These tests are essential, from spotting cancerous cells to determining a patient’s muscle stiffness.  As you have seen, there are many different types of pathology tests. Still, the most basic types focus on removing stains for different cell types, organs, and tissues in their respective exam rooms. 4 reasons why you need apathology testare: 1. Identifies likely health risks:A pathology test can help you determine your risk of developing a specific disease in the future by checking the levels of certainproteins and antibodies in your blood. For example, if you’re worried about heart disease, a cholesterol test is an excellent place to start. 2. Screening for disease:Some pathology tests are used as part of a screening process. For example, if you’re over 40 years old and haven’t had a pap smear before, your doctor might recommend one, so they can check for signs of cervical cancer or other conditions that could cause problems later on. 3. Diagnosing the correct disease:An accurate diagnosis is vital if you have symptoms that point towards a specific condition or disease. This will help your doctor decide what treatment options are best suited to you and whether any further investigations are needed. 4. Monitoring a condition or treatment:Some pathology tests aim to find out how well treatments are working or whether you’ve experienced any changes in your health. For instance, if you have diabetes, you may need regular blood tests to determine how well your glucose levels (blood sugar) are functioning. If you want to get apathology testdone, you have to reach out to a lab specializing in the same. Dr. Remedies Labs is the best in pathology tests, and they offer you the best packages for every test at an affordable price. They even help you get your reports that come from the lab, analyzed.

Carmelina: Well, its always been important to me. Its actually the backbone of everything I do! Science is an integral part of everyday living, such as weather and how we use weather, medicine, when earthquakes happen, getting food sources from agriculture, designing useful technology to assist in gathering data for us to have knowledge, but also have application in our world. This is essential for us to see the connection to science facts and theories and apply this information to everyday living. SSEC: What would you describe as your most memorable moment during the professional development sessions? Carmelina: The most memorable moments happened when teachers would learn new content and information and then demonstrate their understanding in creative and engaging ways. I love to see them have these moments of realization and how their passion after learning new information translates into their own instruction. SSEC:How has participating in and also leading professional development onSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacted your own practice? Carmelina:Its all about the connections to the joy of teaching and getting the chance to reflect with teachers on their classroom instruction by sharing ideas on strategies, assessment, student engagement, and supplemental resources that would complement instruction. I have gained so much by working together online with the teachers to explore scientific phenomenon and content and then putting it into practice by facilitating fun, engaging, inquiry, and standards-based lessons with students. In this screenshot from PD, Carmelina facilitates a conversation with teachers using padlet about the red-cockaded woodpecker. SSEC: What type of support does this give teachers as they go through these types of experiences? Carmelina:I really like that teachers not only learn about curricular resources that are standards-based, engaging, and inquiry-based, but they also get a chance to do the activities and learn from one other. The teachers that I worked with exchanged great ideas with other teachers about how to approach different lessons and were very receptive to learning from each other. SSEC: How do you seeSmithsonian Science for the Classroomimpacting the practice of South Carolina teachers? Carmelina: South Carolina teachers will benefit greatly by having these modules available in their classrooms because all investigations are standards-based and highly engaging. The lessons are also adaptable to both physical and virtual classroom settings and enable teachers and their students to investigate science phenomena together. SSEC: What are the benefits to students experiencingSmithsonian Science for the Classroommodules? Carmelina: Students will benefit greatly because teachers have practiced the lessons with their peers prior to using the module materials and resources. If teachers consistently experience the best practices in science instruction and have a chance to learn and reflect with their peer teachers, then you will see exemplary science instruction and student achievement in the classrooms.",586.0

2024-04-28 15:57:22,Disease_Symptoms,10 Things to Know Before Selecting a Diagnostic Center,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/10-things-to-know-before-selecting-a-diagnostic-center/,"Are you looking for a diagnostic center to diagnose your child or family?Diagnostic centersare necessary for determining the health problem. It’s a place that accounts for any health issues and provides treatment if needed. A diagnostic center performs various tests to determine the cause of the condition. There are different types of labs within this category, including radiology & MRI centers, imaging centers, pathology labs, etc. Do you know what questions to ask when checking a diagnostic center? Choosing thebest diagnostic centercan be confusing when you don’t know what questions to ask. Learn how to choose the best diagnostic center based on the doctors who’ve been there and on other features. There are several essential factors to consider before selecting the best Diagnostic center: 1. Qualification of the medical staff A diagnostic center should have a qualified medical staff to handle your health issues. The center should have experienced and skilledradiologists, pathologists, surgeons, and other medical professionals. The doctors are highly qualified and experienced in their specialty. They also have enough knowledge about different tests and procedures to be followed when treating an individual. The most important thing is to ensure that the doctor you choose has a license to practice medicine in your state. This license allows them to treat patients legally and prescribe medicines according to their needs. 2. Availability of the latest equipment All diagnostic centers use advanced technology for their services. You should check whether the facility has the latest equipment or not. If it does not, then you cannot expect high-quality results from them. 3. Ambiance and hygiene Every diagnostic center must follow proper hygiene while providing its services. If they do not follow these measures, there is a risk of infection among patients and medical professionals working at the facility. Therefore, make sure that they follow all safety measures while performing their tests on patients! 4. Quality of the services It is essential to look at what kind of quality services your preferred diagnostic center offers for its patients to ensure that it will meet all your needs. Make sure that the facility provides excellent care and attention to its patients. 5. Range and availability of tests The diagnostic center should be familiar with all types of diagnostic testing and procedures required to diagnose various diseases or conditions. It should provide a wide range of tests, includingblood tests, urine tests, X-rays, etc., which can help identify various diseases in children such as diabetes, cancer, thyroid disorders, and more. Make sure that there is no delay for these tests as they may be required at short notice due to an emergency or sudden change in your child’s health condition. 6. Ease of scheduling an appointment It is imperative that you can schedule an appointment quickly at the diagnostic center without having to wait for a long time or keep calling back repeatedly until someone is available. They should assist you with all your questions about scheduling appointments for yourself or your children and any other related queries that may arise during this process, for instance, payment options. 7. Accuracy in test results You must check the accuracy of results before choosing any diagnostic center because it is vital if you are planning on taking any medication after receiving these results from them and from other clinics, hospitals, or laboratories where they send samples for examination. 8. Turnaround time for test results delivery They should be able to provide you with accurate results within a short period of time so that you don’t have to wait for weeks or months before getting your results back from them or another medical institute or hospital where they send the samples for further examination and treatment if necessary based on those results. 9. Pricing and payment facilities across various diagnostic centers You need to understand how much each test costs at the diagnostic center before deciding where to go for testing. The best way to find out about this information is by asking them directly about it or by checking for yourself online or on other websites so that you don’t get overcharged for your tests when you go there. 10. Experience and customer reviews Another thing to consider when choosing a diagnostic center is its reputation and experience. It’s essential that the center has been around for some time and has a good track record for treating patients with similar conditions as yours. This shows that they have successfully treated other patients with similar conditions and, therefore, can give you confidence in their ability to treat yours too! The best way to check out their reputation is by searching online reviews, especially those posted by former patients who have used them before The cost of the services offered by the center should also be considered. You need to know that not all diagnostic centers are the same. Some offer high-quality services while others do not.

2024-04-28 16:00:23,science_education,5 Takeaways as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Intern,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/5-takeaways-smithsonian-science-global-goals-intern,"Just a few months ago, I was scouring the Internet as a high school senior, trying to find a way to spend my summer before starting my freshman year of college. I have always been drawn to the Smithsonian, from its thriving museums and centers that share ideas to the expansive network of researchers creating new knowledge. I knew I wanted to contribute to this amazing community before I left the greater Washington D.C. Area. I was thrilled to participate as a summer intern with the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC). Now that my internship is drawing to an end (sadly!) I have five takeaways I learned from my experience as a Smithsonian Science for Global Goals intern working on the Biotechnology! community research guide. Whether youre an aspiring SSEC intern, incoming college freshman, or anywhere in between, I hope this can be helpful. 1. Try something new. Exploring unexplored interests can be exciting yet nerve-wracking. Before SSEC, I had done work in STEM education, lab research, public speaking, and writing. But I had never really had an experience that tied my interdisciplinary interests together. In joining the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Team, I could simultaneously explore the field of STEM curriculum development while also diving into new topics like biotechnology in agriculture and the environment that I might have never thought to explore. My nervousness in this uncharted territory was alleviated by the fact that my life will probably only get busier from here on out; if not now, when? 2. Do your background research. Ever see something and go, Wow, I have no idea what this is? That was me pretty much every day during my internship! But only because I was discovering so much new information each day. I found that in order to translate high level material into the simplified language needed for student-facing materials, you must first become a high level expert yourself. Know that its okay if you dont know things now, but take notes and stockpile resources along the way. Youll thank yourself later! 3. Diverse teamwork makes the dream work. Diversity of backgrounds and ideas makes a concept stronger. While researching a part of the Biotechnology! guide on the environment, I had an unforgettable discussion with Smithsonian researcher and coral expert Dr. Mary Hagedorn. She used the example of diversity in humans as a tool to help students understand the importance of biodiversity in ecosystems. Differences in backgrounds and ideas make a society stronger, just like biodiversity makes an ecosystem stronger. A simple concept, sure, but its true! As I worked with other interns from around the United States and the globe, I got to hear perspectives that I had never heard before. This helped make my work more inclusive and thoughtful. I always walked away from each brainstorming session having gone a step further conceptually and learned something new. 4. Thinking takes time. Nevertheless, there will be a period where youre trying to find a clear path within all the wonderful ideas you have. Attending a staff Lesson Jam, which is a brainstorming session where all of SSEC comes together to hash out a specific idea, illustrated this process to me. For 30 minutes, a group of highly-educated adults talked about everything from the solubility of Kool-Aid to what scenario we should use for a math problem. Although we didnt pin down one idea at the end, Im confident that that conversation helped create the final product, and I had a lot of fun. Brainstorming can be a worthwhile challenge that you dont have to tackle on your own. 5. Enjoy the process! I will never forget the camaraderie that happened in between the lines during SSEC: diving into tangents on carbon sequestration and cloning in a one-on-one advisor meeting; bonding over high school life in an intern hangout after work; and fellow interns hyping each other up for our individual successes. While I may have had a lot going on this summer (working, moving, and the pre-frosh grind included) I always looked forward to anything SSEC related. Every connection I made has shaped me into someone who will continue to discover, understand, and act for a lifetime.",698.0
27/04/2024 15:59,Fashion_Beauty,The Essential Skincare Routine: Unveiling a Radiant You  ,https://pages.daraz.pk/wow/gcp/daraz/channel/pk/-the-fashion-store/footwear-men?spm=a2a0e.tm800153859.9605157410.4.4d8f581apTXxy1&pfilter=1010Badge_202807,"Glowing, healthy skin is the foundation of a beautiful complexion. A consistent skincare routine is key to achieving and maintaining that coveted radiance. However, navigating the vast array of products and conflicting advice can be overwhelming. Here's a breakdown of the essential steps for a simple yet effective skincare routine. Cleansing is the first step to a healthy complexion. It removes makeup, dirt, and oil that accumulate throughout the day, allowing your skincare products to penetrate more effectively. Choose a cleanser suited to your skin type. For oily skin, a gel cleanser is ideal. Dry skin benefits from a creamy cleanser, while combination skin might require a balancing formula. Avoid harsh scrubs that can strip your skin's natural oils  gentle circular motions with your fingertips are sufficient. Cleanse your face twice a day  in the morning to remove sleep residue and at night to wash away makeup and daily impurities. Toners were traditionally used to restore the skin's pH balance after cleansing. However, many modern cleansers already perform this function. Toners can still be beneficial for those with oily skin, as they can help minimize pores. Opt for alcohol-free formulas that are gentle and hydrating. Moisturizing is crucial for all skin types, regardless of whether you have oily or dry skin. Hydration plumps the skin, reduces the appearance of fine lines, and gives you a healthy glow. Choose a moisturizer formulated for your skin type  a lightweight lotion for oily skin, a richer cream for dry skin, and an oil-free gel for combination skin. Apply moisturizer twice a day, after cleansing and toning (if using). Don't forget to moisturize your neck as well. Sun protection is the most important step in any skincare routine. Sun damage is a leading cause of premature aging, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every single day, even on cloudy days. Reapply sunscreen every two hours, or more often if you're sweating or swimming. Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, revealing a brighter, smoother complexion. Exfoliate 1-2 times a week, depending on your skin type. For sensitive skin, choose a gentle chemical exfoliant. Those with oily skin can benefit from a physical exfoliant like a scrub, but avoid harsh scrubbing motions. While this routine provides a solid foundation, it's important to listen to your skin's individual needs. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to different products and adjust your routine accordingly. If you experience any irritation or redness, discontinue use of the product and consult a dermatologist. For truly radiant skin, a healthy lifestyle goes hand-in-hand with your skincare routine. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated from the inside out. Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to nourish your skin. Get enough sleep for optimal cell regeneration. By incorporating these essential steps and healthy habits, you can achieve a healthy, radiant complexion that reflects your inner beauty.",484.0
