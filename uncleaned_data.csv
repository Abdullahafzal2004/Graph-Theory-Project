That’s whyregular checkupsfor most people are essential to good health. Your eyes, ears, heart, and many other parts of your body need to be checked regularly to ensure nothing is developing in a problematic way. Regular health checkupsare a great way to keep your body in good condition and ensure you stay healthy throughout your life. You may not think much about your health, but regular checkups are essential to any medical treatment plan. Here are some of the mainadvantages of having regular health checkups. Advantages of Regular Full Health Check ups It helps you keep track of your health status and helps you stay on top of any changes in your body. It allows your doctor to monitor your medications and make changes if needed, ensuring that they’re working as they should be. Improvement in overall health status is possible. In addition to catching common illnesses such as colds and the flu, regular checkups can detect other diseases that are easier to spot in day-to-day activities (e.g., high blood pressure). It is essential to know that the earlier a disease is detected, the better your chances are of getting better. By having regular checkups, you can prevent the onset of diseases that could potentially threaten your life in the future. It’s easier to treat an illness when it’s still in its early stages. Many illnesses don’t show symptoms for years, so people who skip their annual checkups may not realize they’re sick until it’s too late. Early detection of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes can significantly increase your chances of surviving these diseases. Reduce risk factors for chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels through medication management and lifestyle changes (if necessary). Enhances overall health by detecting and treating medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, etc. Regular health monitors help you identify lifestyle habits affecting your overall health, such as smoking or drinking too much alcohol.

2024-04-28 15:59:28,science_education,"Professional Development in North and South Carolina, vol. 2",https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/professional-development-north-and-south-carolina-vol-2,"The Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC) launched theSmithsonian Science for North and South Carolina Classroomsprogram in 2019 with a U.S. Department of Education early phaseEducation Innovation and Research (EIR)grant. Read the first installment in this blog serieshere. Donna Godley is a fifth grade science teacher at Tryon Elementary School in North Carolina and her school's site coordinator, responsible for supporting her fellow teachers and communicating with the other key players in the program. In March and August 2021, she attended professional development on the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom moduleHow Can We Provide Freshwater to Those in Need?in preparation for implementing it with her students. We spoke with Donna to learn more about her experiences with the program.  SSEC: How did you feel when you learned you were going to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for North Carolina and South Carolina program? Did you have any expectations? Donna:Our Superintendent signed our school up and was looking for teachers to be a part of the program. I teach 5th grade science and were departmentalized. So after I volunteered, I also became a coordinator for my school. I worked with some of the Smithsonian Science units before and traveled to D.C. with other teachers for Smithsonian-related things several years ago. The quality of the Smithsonian programs are usually pretty good, so I felt like the effort I would be putting into it would be worth it for my students. What was your experience with the Smithsonian Science for the Classroom module you covered during the professional development? What was your experience going through the curriculum during the professional development? My unit was an [Engineering] design unit, and its about moving water from one area to another. The people that weve worked with anytime weve done the training have been great. Its been virtual, of course, because of COVID but the instructors have always been really good. The written materials, especially the teacher manual, is always so self explanatory because it covers everything in great detail. You can watch the videos if you have questions on anything. The teacher materials and the resources the Smithsonian Science Education Center provides are exceptional. Actually sitting through the material makes me more familiar with it, and I could teach the lessons without professional development because the materials are so high quality.  In this screenshot from PD, Donna describes her group's rationale for sorting images of landforms in a jamboard. What was it like for you to work with other teachers and coordinators during the training? It was great to receive feedback from others. I worked with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade teachers from my school to help them figure out how they were going to teach the lessons. At the end of each year we hold a debrief to discuss highlights and how were going to work through certain challenges and implement them for the following school year. What has this experience been like for your students? The kids have loved it. With all of the hands-on activities, they say oh, were really scientists! It was so exciting for them to see crates of new materials they were going to work with. They really enjoy doing the design units because they had the opportunity to be creative and use the materials how they liked. Usually when Im doing things in my classroom, theres not a wealth of material to use and were limited to what Ive purchased. Everyone was very engaged because they were so enthralled with everything they were getting to use. They really enjoy being creative and it has really helped them with teamwork. In 5th grade, getting along and working together is a challenge. Theyre motivated to work together during this unit, which is a great thing to have toward the end of the school year. What is a memorable takeaway for you from professional development training? Actually doing the materials together was really impactful to me. Were learning how to move water from one place to another and design water filtration systems. There were some funny moments along the way that were memorable tooat one point my filter completely collapsed! When I started doing this unit with the kids, I could make suggestions along the way so that they didnt completely lose everything. How has this professional development challenged you to think differently about science education? Ive always considered myself a constructionist, where I dont tell students things but let them discover it for themselves. This professional development reemphasized that method of teaching and how important it is. Once the students learn it for themselves, they dont forget it. If theyre just told what to do, it goes in one ear and out the other. If they discover it for themselves, they can apply it to other situations.",800
2024-04-28 15:56:31,Disease_Symptoms,8 Signs and Symptoms of Hypothyroidism,https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/8-signs-and-symptoms-of-hypothyroidism/,"Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a major condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough crucial hormones. There are differentsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidismto notify, in order to get a quality medical response faster. Hypothyroidism might not always offer noticeable symptoms at the early stages, but with time, untreated hypothyroidism will cause serious health issues like infertility, joint pain, obesity, and heart issues. So, proper thyroid tests are essential to perform once you have covered the basicsigns of hypothyroidism. It helps in diagnosing the issue and getting quality results accordingly. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is a pretty simple, effective, and safe one, once you have coveredthyroid infection symptomsquickly and your doctor came across the right dose to use. 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism: Searching the vast world of the internet will not just let you learn about thehypothyroidism effectsbut also provides some surprisingsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is vital to learn about the 8 surprising symptoms of hypothyroidism so that you can get medical attention faster. One of the majorsigns of hypothyroidism, depression will offer mental instability that you want to avoid from the get-go. It is true that hypothyroidism causes the brain to slow down a bit. So, that makes it difficult for the patients to focus, resulting in clinical depression. Most people underestimate the depression level caused by hypothyroidism these days. Whenever you compromise your mood, you will start feeling stiff and weak. These are some of the basicthyroid infection symptomsto watch out for. Unexpected weight gain is another one of the probablehypothyroidism effectson your body. The low-thyroid individuals are signaling their muscles, liver, and even fat tissues to hold onto calories. Whenever your thyroid levels are low, the metabolism will switch modes. So, in place of burning calories for activity and growth, the basal metabolic rate will start to decrease. Therefore, the body starts to store more calories from diet much like fat. Gaining weight seems to be a pretty obvious sign due to such conditions. Even though hypothyroidism can cause some serious issues with memory jogging, some research and scientific notes have proved that it won’t lead to any permanent cognitive dysfunction. So, even though you might face some memory problems, it is only for a limited time span. With proper medications from doctors, you can ward off your memory problems with ease. While looking forsigns and symptoms of hypothyroidism, feeling cold seems to be at the top of the list. Heat is mainly the byproduct of burning calories. As your body isn’t burning enough calories during hypothyroidism, you will always feel cold. With hypothyroidism, your BMR is going to decrease, and that reduces the amount of heat that you get to generate. Along with that, the thyroid hormone turns up the thermostat on brown fat that generates more heat. Such brown heat is mandatory for maintaining heat during cold climates. But, hypothyroidism will prevent such fat from doing its job. Lower thyroid hormones will flip the metabolic switch towards that of catabolism. That’s when the body starts to break down the tissues like muscles for energy. During this catabolism period, muscle strength starts to decrease, leading to weakness. This process of breaking down the muscle tissue will cause aching. So, aching in muscles and joints will be another one of the majorsigns of hypothyroidismto follow. Even though everyone feels weak at least once, hypothyroidism people are likely to feel it twice! Much like most cells, the hair follicles are promisingly regulated by none other than the thyroid hormone. As these follicles are noted to have stem cells with a shorter lifespan and higher turnover round, they are likely to be more sensitive to lower thyroid levels than any other tissue. The lower thyroid will cause these follicles to stop regenerating and that gives rise to hair loss. It can be improved when you can treat the thyroid problem from its core. So, if you are suffering from unwanted hair loss, it is one of the majorthyroid infection symptomsto consider. Recent studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of patients, who are suffering from hair loss, were proven to be suffering from hypothyroidism. Skin cells are further characterized by rapid turnover, much like hair follicles. So, they are pretty sensitive to losing the growth signals from that thyroid hormone. If the normal skin renewal cycle gets broken, it takes more time for the skin to re-grow. So, the outer skin layer has been accumulating damage for a long time. The dead skin, at this time, will take a longer time to shed, resulting in dry skin. Some studies have shown that around 74% of low thyroid patients are suffering from a flaky skin condition. So, it is one of the majorhypothyroidism effectsthat your body faces. Other interesting studies have proven that around 50% of patients with normal thyroid levels have stated to suffer from dry skin for other reasons. Recent studies have shown that 50% of people suffering from hypothyroidism have stated that their skin condition has gotten worse within a year of getting affected. So, if you are one of those unfortunate victims of dry skin, check for your thyroid level right away! Lower thyroid levels surely know how to put some brakes on the colon. Constipation will affect around 17% of those people suffering from hypothyroidism. Around 20% of people with hypothyroidism have stated that their constipation has gotten worse with time. Even though it is a common complaint among patients, it is uncommon for constipation to be the most severe symptom around here. Get proper diagnostics from Remedies Labs: The signs, mentioned above, will help you to clearly decipher if you are suffering from hypothyroidism or not. In case you are facing some serious issues and need help, call the team fromRemedies Labsto the rescue. Get your thyroid diagnosed to start proper medications immediately.

Flipping through photo albums as a child, Shannon Brogdon-Grantham discovered the stories of relatives from the past she never got to meet. Its this activity that inspired her to go after a career as a photo conservator at the Smithsonians Museum Conservation Institute. We always had the family photo albums out at the holidays to look through them. I really got to know a lot of my relatives through photography, Shannon said, I always thought it was really cool that you could see someone from the past and be connected with them. She began college with thinking about a job in forensic medicine, which is the usage of medical knowledge to figure out how a person mightve been hurt during a crime, but she realized her heart was set on a different calling. She switched majors and began to study art history. Thats when she learned about the field of photographic conservation. Even though most people might think of photographs in a photo album, pictures are very important for lots of other reasons. Just like artwork and fossils are clues into the past experiences of people and animals, photographs help tell the stories of people from years ago. By protecting and conserving photos, Shannon can help provide people with important information about the lives of people from different times and places.  Shannon loved science from a young age. She especially loved dissecting an owl pellet, or poop, during class in fourth grade. It was a little gross, but to her, it was mostly exciting. As disgusting as that is, it was really cool, and I was hooked ever since then with science, she explained, I went to a specialty high school that was health sciences and engineering. So, thats when my interest in medicine took hold. Shannon was interested in medicine because she wanted to help people. As a photo conservator shes still helping people. Im one of the few people that gets to connect the past and the present and the future through preservation, Shannon said. Even though shes not curing colds, Shannon is still helping to protect people by making sure their stories can be shared for years to come. Shes protecting peoples cultural heritage by preserving their photos. In addition to protecting photos, Shannon also works to protect mixed media objects that incorporate photos, such as quilts made with photographic images. Quilts can be made to help keep people warm at night, but theyre also made for lots of other reasons, like artistic expression. By understanding how certain quilts are made, Shannon has helped to make sure that these quilts can be preserved for generations to come. Shannon comes from a family of educators, and shes been able to combine education, science, history and art in her career as a photo conservator. Her work is important when it comes to inspiring and teaching people about the diverse experiences of our world.

2024-04-28 15:59:36,science_education,A Sign of Apocalypse,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/sign-apocalypse,"Throughout mankinds history we have looked to the sky for inspiration, navigation, and guidance in understanding our world. Astronomical phenomena have influenced our creation myths and religions. The magnificent display of a lunar eclipse has impacted cultures and inspired fear throughout mankind's past. The lunar eclipse is one of the most documented astronomical occurrences in history. For thousands of years, civilizations have been observing its red glow and attributing meaning to the sight. Many feared that the lunar eclipse was an omen of evil or an indication that tragic events were on the horizon. The Ancient Mesopotamians, one of the early cultures to study astronomy and track the movements of celestial objects, believed that during the lunar eclipse, the Moon was being attacked by demons. Their astronomical observations and recordings were advanced enough that they could predict when a lunar eclipse would occur. In 1502 Christopher Columbus and his men were stranded in Jamaica and had been surviving with help from the native Tano people. However, the natives grew increasingly impatient with the European squatters beginning to refuse aid and supplies to Columbus and his men. Columbus used information from an almanac of astronomical tables, which informed him of the occurrence of a total lunar eclipse within a few days. He told the natives that if they did not continue giving him food and supplies his god would inflame the Moon with his wrath as a sign of future punishment. As predicted the lunar eclipse followed. Terrified by the blood-colored Moon they acquiesced to Columbus demands. Lunar eclipses have also aided in furthering our understanding of our universe. The Greek astronomer and mathematician Aristarchus of Samos, known for proposing the first Helio-Centric (sun-centered) model of the solar system made great strides in the field of astronomy. He famously used the occurrence of a lunar eclipse and his understanding of mathematics to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. By using a known size of the Earth and measuring the duration of the lunar eclipse, he was able to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While relatively inaccurate, he was the first to ever do this calculation. While for most people the lunar eclipse no longer signifies the coming of an apocalyptic event, the mystique surrounding the infamous Blood Moon holds to this day. The lunar eclipse is in fact not mystical at all; it is quite simply the Earth passing in between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow on the Moon. As the Moon begins to be shadowed from part of the Sun's light, the Moon will appear to dim (see Figure 1). This is when the Moon passes into an area called the penumbra, the part of the shadow where the entirety of the Moon is still illuminated by the Sunlight, however part of the Sunlight is blocked by the Earth causing the drop in brightness. When just this happens it is called a penumbral eclipse and this accounts for most lunar eclipses. On even rarer occasions, the Moon will then begin to disappear into the night sky. This occurs as the Moon passes into the umbra, where all direct sunlight is blocked casting a dark shadow on the Moon. The Moon will fully disappear entering what is called totality. Then the lunar eclipse shows its true colors. Ethan GevinsonFigure 1. Parts of a lunar eclipse. Image not to scale. Even when the Moon is entirely in the umbral shadow, some light manages to reach the Moon by passing around the Earth, through the atmosphere. This causes a change in color due to a principle called Rayleigh scattering, and this is the same principle that gives the sky its blue color. This principle states that when light passes through a medium such as the atmosphere, shorter wavelength of light is scattered more. What we end up seeing is that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is scattered more than red light since blue light has a shorter wavelength (e.g. Figure 2). This gives the effect of different colors of light being refracted at different angles similar to light passing through a prism. Ethan GevinsonFigure 2. Bluer light has a shorter wavelength and redder light has a longer wavelength. This is also why sunrises and sunsets appear red. As the Sun appears to set on the horizon, the sunlight passes through the longer path of Earths atmosphere to reach your eyes than when it appears high in the sky. The blue light is scattered away while the red light could reach us. Interestingly, when we are looking at a lunar eclipse, the red light projected onto the Moon is the light of sunrises and sunsets that we see on Earth (Figure 3). So if you manage to see a blood Moon, you can consider yourself lucky, as you are seeing the light from all of the sunsets and sunrises from around the world being projected onto the Moon. Ethan GevinsonFigure 3. The light from the Sun being scattered by the atmosphere, giving the Moon its red color. When is the next lunar eclipse? On May 5th, 2023 between 15:15 and 19:32 UTC the Moon will pass into the Penumbra creating a nearly total penumbral eclipse visible from most of Europe, Africa, and Asia (Figure 5). This type of eclipse unfortunately will not result in the iconic Blood Moon, just simply a dimming of the Moon with darker shading on one side. Whether you are able to see the upcoming eclipse or will be holding out until the next total lunar eclipse in March of 2025 it is an impressive sight to behold. People have always looked to the skies for answers and have learned from events like the lunar eclipse. To join them all you need to do is look it up. Ethan GevinsonFigure 4.

2024-04-28 15:56:39,Disease_Symptoms,"Dengue Fever Symptoms, Causes, Preventions and Treatment",https://www.remedieslabs.com/blog/dengue-fever-symptoms-causes-preventions-and-treatment/,"Denguefeveris indeed pretty painful. It is a mosquito-borne disease caused by any one of the four dengue viruses. These viruses are mostly related to the ones which causeyellow fever and West Nile Infection. Our research materials have established that over 400 million dengue infections occur worldwide yearly. Around 96 million result in illnesses. After you have thedengue fever symptomsby your side, we insist you consult the doctor. Most cases primarily occur in tropical areas like The Indian subcontinent, Southern China, Southeast Asia, and more. Dengue fever can be transmitted when an Aedes mosquito bites you. It is already infected with the dengue virus. The mosquito will get infected once it bites a person with the dengue virus in their blood. It fails to spread from one victim to another directly. So, visit us at theRemedies Labsnext time you want to get yourdengue testdone. We will explore all the variations of dengue tests and provide solid, accurate results. The symptoms to follow: Before you proceed with thedengue fever treatment, our experts will discuss the symptoms involved. The symptoms mostly begin around 4 to 6 days after the infection. It can last for about ten days. Some of the most commondengue fever symptomsyou see are listed below for your reference. Mild bleeding like bleeding gums, nose bleed, or easy bruising Skin rashes, which will appear 2 to 5 days after the fever’s onset Vomiting and nausea tendency Fatigue Severe muscle and joint pain Pain behind your eyes Hardcore headaches High fever all of a sudden In some cases,dengue fever symptomsare mild and can be mistaken for viral infection or other types of flu. Younger people who aren’t affected by dengue will have milder cases than adults or older children. But serious issues can take place at any time. Some of those are: Hemorrhagic fever Damage to blood vessels and lymph Gum and nose bleeding Liver enlargement Failure of the circulatory system To avoid taking any chance, it is mandatory to book us at the Remedies Labs whenever you face any such symptom. We will provide you with accurate results instantly. It helps you to move on with the right treatment plan ASAP! The causes behind dengue fever: While learning about whatcausesdengue fever, we will talk about four viruses. They are transmitted by either the Aedes albopictus mosquito or the Aedes aegypti mosquito. These mosquito species reside in tropical and subtropical areas globally. Their related infections have grown big times in recent years. A mosquito that carries the virus will pass it down to a human by biting him. When another mosquito bites an infected person, it picks up the disease and will pass it on to the next person it bites. We believe it to be one of the majorcauses ofdengue fever. A person can indeed suffer from dengue fever more than once. However, they become immune to the specified viruscausingdengue fever, even though they won’t be immune to the other three viruses. Preventive measures to follow: You must catch up with us atRemedies Labsif you suffer fromdengue fever. We will explore all the options that your doctors prescribe regardingdengue tests. But we will also let you know about the preventive measure to follow. It helps to keep the infection out of your side. On May 2009, FDA approved the first dengue vaccine. It helps withdengue fever preventioncaused by all four viruses. These vaccines were for people within the age group of 9 to 16 years and with a history to follow. People who are not quite eligible to get the shots or vaccines asdengue fever preventivemeasures can always reduce the risk by taking steps to avoid any kind of mosquito bites. For that, we suggest you wear clothes to cover most parts of your body and use mosquito repellents on the exposed areas. Anotherdengue fever preventivemethod is to use mosquito nets any time of the day and not just during nighttime. Invest some bucks on door and window screens. Remove any stagnant water around your place. Avoid camping on wet grounds. Take time to check that your plan pots, drains and other features are not collecting water. It prevents you from being a victim ofdengue fever. If you still suffer from any of the symptoms mentioned before, go for the best test from us at theRemedies Labs. We offer accurate results all the time. The tests to follow: Our commercial testing centres at the Remedies Labs will follow Dengue diagnostic testing.

2024-04-28 15:59:43,science_education,A Global Goals Guide: From Start to Finish,https://ssec.si.edu//stemvisions-blog/global-goals-guide-start-finish,"You may be familiar with the action-focused aim of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides. As explained by Laurie Rosatone, Division Director of Curriculum, Digital Media, and Communications at the Smithsonian Science Education Center (SSEC), the goal is to have anyone picking up these guides feel like there is something that they want to and can do and that they can act in their local communities around these huge global challenges. So, how does the SSEC strive toward this goal while creating the Global Goals guides? How are topics selected among the many issues that the world is facing? Whats the process for developing activities that are as engaging as possible? How is each guide created with accessibility and impact in mind? As an intern for the upcomingBiotechnology!community research guide, I talked with the rest of the SSEC team to dig into these big questions. Heres everything that goes into a Global Goals guide, from start to finish. Each guides beginning traces all the way back to 20162018, when a deep dive into the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals produced alist of tentative topics. Since then, funders have helped to transform the early vision into reality: published guides used by young people around the world! The process of connecting with funders begins with Holly Glover, SSEC's Division Director of Advancement and Partnerships. She says, Since the inception of the SDGs, interest from the funding community around education for sustainable development has grown significantly. These funding partners are excited to be a part of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals Project. As we are seeking to achieve a joint impact with partners, I look at which guides and resources are left unfunded, and seek to align those priority areas with those of our partners. For theBiotechnology!guide, she explains, Biotechnology!was funded by Johnson & Johnson, whose business and philanthropic priorities align to the topics covered within the guide. After receiving funding, the first step is getting organized. Hannah Osborn, Project Manager at SSEC, starts by creating a schedule. She says of her work, I start with the questions, What have we been tasked to do? What is our timeline? How does our budget line up? I then backflow a schedule from there. Once the timeline is constructed, the research begins. The curriculum developers start to explore by digging into big issues surrounding the guides topic and consulting key players in the field. That research is synthesized into an outline detailing the proposed parts of the guide and the essential understandings students will develop while using it. After high-level review and approval of the outline, the guide is ready to move onto the drafting stage. As an intern, I worked with Curriculum Developers Heidi Gibson and Logan Schmidt to conduct further background research and develop activities for the upcomingBiotechnology!guide. Along with our five-strong intern team (made up of high schoolers, college students, and teachers!), I identified sources, probed through research papers, and conducted interviews with subject matter experts to get a strong understanding of each topic. We then worked on integrating key takeaways into engaging activities, which involved brainstorming, gathering data and information, and writing drafts. As we wrapped up our work, Heidi and Logan incorporated the research and activities into writing the initial draft of the guide. This first draft then goes through a rigorous review process that involves a number of voices. Field testing is done with teachers around the world to obtain their feedback as guide users. Technical reviews by experts ensure that the information shared in the guides is scientifically accurate and clear. Internal feedback, involving reviews by Laurie Rosatone and SSEC Director Dr. Carol ODonnell, provide further suggestions that make the guide as user-friendly and impactful as possible. After all of this feedback is integrated into improving the draft, the guide is copy-edited and designed by professionals. Then, it is finally ready to be published! SSECs Marketing & Communications team spreads the word about the completely free, newly released guide through digital marketing (i.e. social media posts and paid advertisements), blog posts, and press releases. Once the guide is released and shared, students and educators everywhere can access it from their devices. To expand the impact of Global Goals, Katherine Blanchard, Assistant Director of Professional Services, and Jackie Kolb, Program Specialist work with educators to implement the guides in their learning communities. Katherine says of their work, When a guide is first released, theres a balance between marketing and implementationwhos sharing that this exists versus whos providing training to actually use it. That gap between knowing about it and using it is one of the biggest things we work to fill. Theres a lot of recruitment of interested educators, building out and developing partnerships for projects (e.g. implementation in certain countries), and working with educators to implement the guides. Finally, the guide enters the final, paramount stage: being used by youth around the world! From beginning to end, youths interests and their ability to ignite change are the foundation of the guides themselves, as Laurie explains: Bringing respect for different peoples backgrounds, lived experiences, and perspectives of problem-solving into the classroom is at the heart of these Global Goals guides. Youre starting with the youthwho arethey? Instead of Who am I to think that I can do science? its Here I am and heres what Im bringing to this. It is really powerful to think about that subtle shift being that important to unlocking students confidence, curiosity, and sense of connection. Its not about empowering them, its tapping into their own sense of agency. I want to give them the confidence that they have the knowledge to step forward. Guide users and the change they have created around the world inspire the SSEC, and were incredibly glad to be a part of that process. Although this post details the development of the Smithsonian Science for Global Goals guides from beginning to end, we know that sharing them with youth is just the beginning of everyone working together towards a sustainable future.",1004
